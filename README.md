## What This Is

`testing-os` is the flagship monorepo of the [Dogfood Lab](https://github.com/dogfood-lab) GitHub org — successor to the now-archived [`mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs`](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs). It bundles the protocols and infrastructure for running, recording, and learning from tests in an AI-native development workflow:

- A **swarm protocol** for running parallel-agent audits against a codebase.
- An **evidence store + schema spine** for the records, findings, patterns, and recommendations that come out of those runs.
- A **policy + verifier** layer that decides what counts as "verified" — and enforces it across consumer repos.
- An **intelligence layer** that turns raw findings into reusable patterns and doctrine.

## Status

Migration from `mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs` complete (2026-04-25). Receiver is live: `dogfood.yml` workflows in consumer repos dispatch to this repo, and [`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`](.github/workflows/ingest.yml) commits the resulting records and indexes back to `main`. Handbook is deployed at [dogfood-lab.github.io/testing-os/](https://dogfood-lab.github.io/testing-os/). v1.0.0 ships once the post-migration polish in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) is complete.

## Packages

| Package | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `@dogfood-lab/schemas` | TypeScript | The 8 JSON schemas (record, finding, pattern, recommendation, doctrine, policy, scenario, submission). |
| `@dogfood-lab/verify` | JS | Central submission validator. Submissions pass through here before they're persisted. |
| `@dogfood-lab/findings` | JS | Finding contract + derive/review/synthesis/advise pipelines. |
| `@dogfood-lab/ingest` | JS | Pipeline glue: dispatch → verify → persist → index. |
| `@dogfood-lab/report` | JS | Submission builder for source repos. |
| `@dogfood-lab/portfolio` | JS | Cross-repo portfolio generator. |
| `@dogfood-lab/dogfood-swarm` | JS | The 10-phase parallel-agent protocol + SQLite control plane + `swarm` bin. |

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dogfood-lab/testing-os.git
cd testing-os
npm install
npm run build       # tsc --build across all packages
npm test            # vitest for schemas, node --test for the rest
npm run verify      # build + test (canonical pre-commit check)
```

Requires Node ≥ 20.

## Versioning

Lockstep across all `@dogfood-lab/*` packages. Currently `0.1.0-pre`; first stable release will be `1.0.0` once the [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) post-migration polish is complete. The version line in this README is auto-stamped from `package.json` via `scripts/sync-version.mjs` (runs as `prebuild`).
