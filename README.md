## What This Is

`testing-os` is the flagship monorepo of the [Dogfood Lab](https://github.com/dogfood-lab) GitHub org — successor to the now-archived [`mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs`](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs). It bundles the protocols and infrastructure for running, recording, and learning from tests in an AI-native development workflow:

- A **swarm protocol** for running parallel-agent audits against a codebase.
- An **evidence store + schema spine** for the records, findings, patterns, and recommendations that come out of those runs.
- A **policy + verifier** layer that decides what counts as "verified" — and enforces it across consumer repos.
- An **intelligence layer** that turns raw findings into reusable patterns and doctrine.

## Status

**v1.0.0 stable** — first stable release after the migration from `mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs` (cut 2026-04-25). Receiver is live: `dogfood.yml` workflows in consumer repos dispatch to this repo, and [`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`](.github/workflows/ingest.yml) commits the resulting records and indexes back to `main`. Handbook is deployed at [dogfood-lab.github.io/testing-os/](https://dogfood-lab.github.io/testing-os/). Consumers can pin to `^1.0.0`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's in the cut.

## Threat Model

testing-os processes dogfood submissions dispatched via `repository_dispatch` from trusted GitHub repos under `mcp-tool-shop-org/*` and `dogfood-lab/*`. The verifier requires GitHub Actions provenance — claimed run IDs are confirmed via the GitHub API, and submissions with malformed shapes, missing references, or invalid policy claims are rejected.

**What testing-os touches:** the submission JSON in each `repository_dispatch` payload; `policies/`, `fixtures/`, `records/`, and `indexes/` in this repo; outbound calls to `api.github.com` for provenance verification.

**What testing-os does NOT touch:** consumer source code, secrets in consumer repos beyond the dispatch envelope, or anything outside this repo's working tree.

**Permissions required:** the receiver workflow runs with `contents: write` scoped to this repo only. Provenance verification uses the workflow's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` for read-only Actions API calls. **No telemetry, no third-party services, no analytics — this codebase neither phones home nor exposes a network surface beyond GitHub.**

## Packages

| Package | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `@dogfood-lab/schemas` | TypeScript | The 8 JSON schemas (record, finding, pattern, recommendation, doctrine, policy, scenario, submission). |
| `@dogfood-lab/verify` | JS | Central submission validator. Submissions pass through here before they're persisted. |
| `@dogfood-lab/findings` | JS | Finding contract + derive/review/synthesis/advise pipelines. |
| `@dogfood-lab/ingest` | JS | Pipeline glue: dispatch → verify → persist → index. |
| `@dogfood-lab/report` | JS | Submission builder for source repos. |
| `@dogfood-lab/portfolio` | JS | Cross-repo portfolio generator. |
| `@dogfood-lab/dogfood-swarm` | JS | The 10-phase parallel-agent protocol + SQLite control plane + `swarm` bin. |

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dogfood-lab/testing-os.git
cd testing-os
npm install
npm run build       # tsc --build across all packages
npm test            # vitest for schemas, node --test for the rest
npm run verify      # build + test (canonical pre-commit check)
```

Requires Node ≥ 20.

## Versioning

Lockstep across all `@dogfood-lab/*` packages — they bump together. The version line in this README is auto-stamped from `package.json` via `scripts/sync-version.mjs` (runs as `prebuild`). All packages are `private: true` for now; npm publish is a separate decision per package.
