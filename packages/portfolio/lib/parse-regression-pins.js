/**
 * Regression pin parser.
 *
 * Scans a directory tree for `F-NNNNNN-NNN` finding-id comment pins in source
 * and test files, returning two maps that the always-on CI gate (Class #14)
 * consumes to enforce "every fixed F-id has a regression test that would have
 * caught the bug."
 *
 * The convention pinned by this parser is:
 *
 *   ```js
 *   // F-721047-004 — POLICIES_ROOT is the parent of all per-org dirs.
 *   ```
 *
 * Either a leading-comment line or an in-test marker like
 * `describe('… (F-721047-001)', …)` counts as a pin. Both source files and
 * test files can carry pins; the CI gate cross-references the two maps.
 *
 * Design constraints:
 *   - JSON-serializable output so the FT-BACKEND-002 `swarm verify-fixed`
 *     command can join its delta against this parser's emit.
 *   - File classification is path-based (`*.test.js|ts|mjs` or any path that
 *     contains `/test/` is "test"; everything else is "source"). No glob
 *     library — a plain filter over the tracked file set.
 *   - The candidate set is what git tracks (see `lib/tracked-files.js`), so
 *     untracked and ignored files are never scanned.
 *   - On top of that, skips `node_modules`, `dist`, `coverage`, and any
 *     directory whose name starts with `.` except `.github`.
 *
 * Companion to FT-BACKEND-002 (`swarm verify-fixed` runtime check) and
 * FT-OUTPUTS-001 (this commit-time check). Together they operationalize
 * Class #14 (claimed-fixed without verification) — the runtime gate runs
 * on demand, this parser feeds the always-on CI gate.

/**
 * F-id pattern — three formats, unioned, because this repo has minted three
 * distinct id shapes over its history and the gate that consumes this
 * pattern must see all of them (F-3ec5b54f):
 *
 *   1. LEGACY   `F-NNNNNN-NNN`      — six digits, dash, three digits
 *      (the dogfood-labs era; still the majority of source pins).
 *   2. HASH     `F-xxxxxxxx`        — exactly 8 lowercase hex chars, the
 *      short-hash style every fix minted in current sessions uses
 *      (e.g. this file's own F-3ec5b54f / F-5eafee44). Pre-fix this whole
 *      class was INVISIBLE to the gate — 77 of 133 real source pins.
 *   3. PREFIXED `F-AAA[-AAA...]-NNN` — one or more dash-joined uppercase-
 *      alnum segments (`CI`, `W1`, `VERIFYCLI`, `CI-SELF-DOGFOOD`, …) then a
 *      three-digit suffix. Also invisible pre-fix — 16 of 133.
 *
 * Each branch's trailing quantifier is followed by a same-class negative
 * lookahead (`(?!\d)` for a digit suffix, `(?![0-9a-f])` for the hex run) so
 * a LONGER run than the branch expects (a 4-digit suffix, a 9-char hex run)
 * produces NO match rather than a silently truncated wrong id — fail closed,
 * never guess.
 *
 * Case is the load-bearing disambiguator between branches 2 and 3: hash ids
 * are always lowercase hex, prefixed segments are always uppercase alnum, so
 * `[0-9a-f]{8}` and `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*` never contend for the same text (JS
 * regex classes are case-sensitive by default; no `/i` flag here on purpose).
 *
 * The three EXISTING negative cases this file's tests pin (`F-005`, an
 * under-length legacy shape; `F-XXX-yyy`, uppercase-then-LOWERCASE, which
 * fails branch 3's uppercase-only continuation; `F-12-345`, digit-led,
 * which fails branch 3's uppercase-FIRST-char requirement) all still
 * correctly fail every branch — verified in parse-regression-pins.test.js
 * alongside the new positive cases, not just asserted here.
 *
 * Known accepted false positive: a prose example that is ITSELF shaped like
 * a valid prefixed id (e.g. a comment illustrating a hypothetical collision
 * with the literal text `F-XXXXXX-001`) is structurally indistinguishable
 * from a real prefixed id — "XXXXXX" satisfies `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*` exactly like
 * "COORD" or "VERIFY" does. This is not a regex problem to over-fit away
 * (a curated exclude-list of placeholder tokens is its own maintenance
 * burden and the next placeholder just needs a different token); it is
 * exactly what `scripts/regression-pin-allowlist.json` exists to absorb —
 * the same mechanism the 3 pre-existing legacy orphans already use.

 * than the `.test.`/`.spec.` dot form below — it also collects `foo-test.js`,
 * `foo_test.js`, and bare `test.js` (dash/underscore-suffixed or exactly
 * "test", not just dot-suffixed). Pre-fix, a real, executing test file named

 * inside it invisible to the regression-pin gate (a false orphan — the SAFE
 * direction, but still a structural gap between "what node --test collects"
 * and "what this parser credits as test evidence"). Matches at a path
 * boundary (`^`, `/`, `-`, or `_` immediately before "test.<ext>") so it does
 * NOT also swallow the ALREADY-handled dot form (`foo.test.js` has a `.`
 * immediately before "test.", not one of these four) or an unrelated
 * substring match (`protest.js` has no separator before "test." at all).
 * Verified empirically against the live repo tree: zero files match either
 * the new or the pre-existing forms today, so this is a pure widening with
 * no observable reclassification of any current file (see the "F-a27680f9"
 * describe block in parse-regression-pins.test.js).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done here (see the finding's own fix note): narrowing the
 * `/test/`+`/tests/` path-segment rule below to also require a test-like
 * filename. That direction trades this gate's current "err toward crediting
 * too much" posture for "err toward crediting too little," which is a wider,
 * riskier blast radius than this LOW/zero-live-risk finding warrants without
 * first auditing every non-test-named file already living under a `test/` or
 * `tests/` directory repo-wide for a real, now-orphaned pin — left as
 * optional future hardening if this repo's naming conventions actually
 * drift, per the finding's own "no action required unless" framing.
 *
 * F-d01977e5 (LOW, wave 22, confirming audit of F-a27680f9): the fix above
 * names three additional default-discovery forms but `node --test` (v22.22.3,
 * this repo's CI matrix) collects a FOURTH, distinct one: a leading `test-`
 * PREFIX component (e.g. `test-foo.js`) — empirically confirmed to run under
 * a bare `node --test`, while `test_foo.js` (underscore prefix) and
 * `testFoo.js` (no separator) do NOT run, isolating the prefix form
 * specifically to a dash. This is a fourth, separate glob from the three
 * NODE_TEST_SUFFIX_PATTERN above already encodes — none of those three match
 * "test-" as a LEADING path component (they only match "test." as a
 * TRAILING one). The alternation below adds it: `(?:^|\/)` requires either
 * start-of-string or a `/` immediately before "test-" (mirroring the
 * suffix-side boundary discipline one alternative over), then `[^/]*`
 * consumes the rest of the basename before the extension — so it cannot
 * cross a `/` and match a `test-*` DIRECTORY name the way a naive substring
 * search would. Verified against the same live-tree grep the F-a27680f9 fix
 * used (`test-*.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,tsx,jsx}`, excluding node_modules/.swarm/
 * dist/.git): exactly one hit anywhere in the repo
 * (`packages/dogfood-swarm/test-support-strip-comments.test.js`, outside this
 * package's domain), and that file already ends in `.test.js`, so it is
 * independently caught by classifyFile()'s FIRST rule regardless of this
 * widening — a pure widening with zero observable reclassification, exactly
 * like its three siblings (see the "F-d01977e5" cases in the "F-a27680f9"
 * describe block in parse-regression-pins.test.js).
 *
 * F-92a8d0bb (MED, wave 24, confirming audit of this file's classifyFile()):
 * revisits the "Deliberately NOT done here" call above and splits it in two.
 * `/test/` (singular) was never an "err toward crediting too much" trade-off
 * — empirically reconfirmed (candidate fixtures written to a clean scratch
 * dir, bare `node --test` run twice for certainty, v22.22.3) that node's own
 * default recursion collects ANY basename under a directory literally named
 * `test`, at any nesting depth. The blanket credit for `/test/` is an exact
 * match to real discovery, not a generous margin, and stays as-is.
 * `/tests/` (plural) and `/__tests__/` are a DIFFERENT case: the same
 * empirical probe found node's bare `--test` recursion collects NOTHING
 * under either directory name unless the basename independently matches one
 * of the suffix/prefix rules already checked above — so the blanket credit
 * this file used to give both was a genuine false-grant-shaped gap (a
 * `@pins` tag placed in, say, `tests/helpers.js` earned Tier-1
 * "declared/verified" credit for a test `npm test` would never run), not a
 * deliberate safety margin. The migration-safety concern the paragraph above
 * raised — auditing every currently-tracked file under `tests/` or
 * `__tests__/` for a real pin that would newly orphan — is satisfied here,
 * not deferred: `git ls-files | grep -E '(^|/)(tests|__tests__)/'` returns
 * nothing repo-wide, so removing the blanket credit for those two directory
 * names reclassifies zero currently-tracked files. See classifyFile()'s

 * classifyFile() — the exact "probe the CLASS boundary" sweep F-92a8d0bb's
 * own text said it ran, one rule above the code it patched): the blanket
 * `.spec.` credit classifyFile() used to give ANY `*.spec.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,
 * tsx,jsx}` file, repo-wide, had zero awareness that this repo runs TWO test
 * runners across its 6 packages (each package's own `scripts.test`):
 * packages/schemas runs `vitest run`; the other five (verify, findings,
 * ingest, report, portfolio) all run bare `node --test`.
 *
 * Empirically re-derived from a clean state, not carried over from
 * F-92a8d0bb's prose (per swarms/PROTOCOL.md's "Fixing a class, not an
 * instance" — source/reality wins): fixtures written to isolated scratch
 * dirs, run against a bare `node --test` (v22.22.3, this repo's pinned CI
 * version), three separate rounds (ESM twice for certainty, CJS once). A
 * `.spec.{js,cjs}` file was tried at five locations — top level, nested one
 * dir, under `test/` (singular), under `tests/` (plural), and under
 * `__tests__/` — alongside a sibling `.test.{js,cjs}` control at the same
 * locations. Identical result across all three rounds: the `.test.` control
 * ran every time; the `.spec.`-only file NEVER ran except under `test/`
 * (singular) — and that one exception is fully explained by the ALREADY-
 * independent `/test/`-blanket rule below (any basename qualifies there),
 * not by `.spec.` itself. Separately, real `vitest` (v4.1.9, this repo's
 * pinned version, invoked with no config file present — pure default
 * `include`) WAS confirmed to discover a `.spec.js` file at top level and a
 * `.spec.ts` file nested under an arbitrarily-named subdirectory, no extra
 * configuration needed — so the credit was not wrong, only unscoped.
 *
 * This exact `node --test`/`.spec.` fact already exists, named and fixed, in
 * a sibling gate: scripts/stageC-check-test-floor.test.mjs's
 * `NODE_BARE_DISCOVERY_RE` (F-4d5e0db4 / F-113b0115, commit 59af8c7,
 * 2026-07-02) carries the comment "NOT .ts/.tsx (no transpiler) and NOT
 * .spec. naming — claiming those covered is the F-4d5e0db4 / F-113b0115
 * over-claim." That gate and this one independently disagreed about the same
 * underlying runtime fact for two weeks; this fix generalizes the already-
 * correct model into classifyFile() rather than a future sweep re-deriving
 * it a third time.
 *
 * Fix shape: SCOPE the credit to packages/schemas rather than dropping it
 * repo-wide. Dropping it entirely would trade today's live false-grant for a
 * future false-orphan the first time a schemas contributor reaches for the
 * Vitest-idiomatic `.spec.` name out of habit — schemas' own test/ dir is
 * 100% `.test.ts` today, but `.spec.` is real, executing evidence there, and
 * there is no reason to make the gate blind to it. A named, single-package
 * exception — same "don't widen without re-deriving the risk" discipline as
 * DOT_DIR_SCAN_ALLOWLIST above; extend this only if a SECOND package's own
 * `scripts.test` genuinely adopts a `.spec.`-discovering runner, never as a
 * general opt-in.
 *
 * REACHABILITY: `git ls-files | grep -E '\.spec\.[mc]?[jt]sx?$'` returns
 * nothing repo-wide, so this is a pure tightening — zero currently-tracked
 * files reclassify. classifyFile() has exactly one implementation (grepped
 * the full tree for a second `.spec.`-crediting classifier and separately
 * for the identifier `classifyFile`; only this file's own module/test files
 * matched, plus an unrelated domain-OWNERSHIP bucket list in
 * packages/dogfood-swarm/lib/domains.js that buckets files for swarm
 * agent-domain routing — a different concern from "did a test runner
 * execute this file," and out of this domain's glob regardless), imported
 * (never copied) by scripts/suggest-pins.mjs,
 * scripts/check-finding-regression-pins.mjs, and scripts/pin-declarations.mjs
