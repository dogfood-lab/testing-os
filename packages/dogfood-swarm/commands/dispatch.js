## Verification discipline (parallel-wave)

This wave is running under the **serial-final-verify** discipline. Other agents are landing edits in parallel; running \`npm test\` / \`npm run verify\` from your worktree right now would observe a cumulative tree that is still in motion, producing measurement artifacts (e.g. a test that fails because a sibling agent hasn't yet landed its half of a coordinated fix).

**Do NOT run per-agent verification.** Make your edits, write your output JSON, and stop. The coordinator runs ONE \`npm run verify\` against the cumulative tree after \`swarm collect\` (PROTOCOL.md §Serial final verification).

Set \`verification_skipped: true\` at the top level of your output JSON to make the contract explicit:

\`\`\`json
{
  "domain": "...",
  "summary": "...",
  "fixes": [...],
  "files_changed": [...],
  "verification_skipped": true
}
\`\`\`

## Cost bounds (parallel-wave) — these override any coordinator brief that says otherwise

Earned on armature, 2026-09-06: three waves in one day exhausted a weekly token budget. Every rule
below is a hard bound, not advice.

1. **No full-suite runs by an agent.** Do not measure "the isolated floor before your first edit";
   the coordinator states the floor in the brief. After your fixes, run ONLY the test modules your
   fixes touch, once, on the plain interpreter. The \`-O\` leg, the full suite and the package build
   are the coordinator's serial verify on the merged tree — never yours.
2. **No per-agent pin re-derivation.** Censuses and pins are measured ONCE by the coordinator at the
   merge with each module's own derivation. If a fix of yours moves a pin inside a module you own,
   update that one literal and say so in the fix's \`family:\` line; do not re-derive the tree.
3. **Relay posts are facts, not essays.** One post BEFORE the first edit only when a shared surface
   (a string another domain prints, a signature another domain calls) is at stake; one post at
   commit with what changed as TEXT. Each under 300 words. No re-statements of the brief.
4. **Probes are scripts by path, never stdin.** No heredoc into an interpreter, no \`python -\`; a
   stdin probe has hung a worktree for hours three times.
5. **One reverted-red proof per finding**, run against the affected module only.
6. **Stop when your findings are fixed.** Do not audit beyond your list, do not sweep siblings, do
   not "measure for the next audit" — file one line under \`OUT-OF-DOMAIN:\` and stop.

 * F-166ab759 (HIGH): no size bound anywhere on generated wave-brief .md

 * on Lost-in-the-Middle (Liu et al. 2023, arXiv:2307.03172) -- a bounded
 * digest at the TOP of a brief is worthless if the REST of the brief is
 * free to grow unbounded underneath it wave over wave. This constant is the
 * WARN-first ceiling that closes that gap.
 *
 * Grounded in the measured, real distribution -- every wave-<N>/<domain>.md
 * brief this run has ever produced (276 files, `wc -c`, see this finding's
 * own amend-lane report for the exact command): sizes range from 2,573 bytes
 * (wave 1) to 1,090,242 bytes (wave 44, the current latest). The corpus is
 * NOT uniformly large -- it is two tiers, cleanly separable by phase:
 * `*-audit` waves (health-audit-a/b, stage-d-audit, feature-audit) carry
 * the accumulated findings-history + roadmap digest and grow ~monotonically
 * wave over wave (wave 3: 105KB -> wave 27: 718KB -> wave 44: 1,090KB);
 * `*-amend`/`*-execute` waves are scoped to just that wave's routed
 * findings and stay small throughout the run's entire history (a few KB to
 * ~30KB, NO growth trend). 750,000 sits at the real historical crossover
 * between the two tiers: the first brief to ever exceed it was wave 28's
 * health-audit-b (753,134 bytes), and every `*-audit` wave since has
 * stayed above it -- including feature-audit, which reset to a small base
 * at wave 38 (a fresh phase family, no accumulated digest yet) and has
 * ALREADY grown back past this threshold by wave 40. That makes this a
 * real, persistent, non-flaky signal on the current corpus, not a number
 * reverse-engineered to just barely catch today's max -- a threshold tuned
 * to ~1.09MB would need re-tuning within 1-2 more waves at the observed
 * growth rate; this one has 16+ waves of headroom behind it already.
 *
 * WARN, never fail: the live corpus already exceeds this ceiling on every
 * recent audit-phase wave, so a hard gate here would brick THIS run's own
 * next dispatch. Putting the corpus on a diet -- paginating findings-
 * history, capping the roadmap digest's own growth further, or archiving
 * old wave sections out of the live brief -- is next-cycle Director
 * material, not a call this WARN-first observability pass makes

 *
 * Absent/unreadable/malformed input degrades to `null` (no digest to seed),
 * never a throw — matching this package's established advisory-content

 *   precedent; the same cross-boundary-trust class F-18d0ef6d/F-a9c399ce
 *   already warn against, moved from cross-domain to cross-run). See

 *   named run's compiled roadmap onto THIS dispatch, bypassing both the
 *   seeded-lineage check and the first-audit-wave gate — the documented way

 *   silent degrade to no-digest — the operator named a specific run this
 *   invocation; T4's contract text is explicit that the behavior must never
 *   be silent in either direction.
 * @param {Function} [opts.runAtlas] — the Atlas runner (lib/atlas.js#runAtlas)

 * @returns {object} — { waveId, waveNumber, agents, promptDir, dryRun? }
 *
 * Atomicity contract (D3B-002, Wave A2 Stage C):
 *   The wave-build DB writes — INSERT INTO waves, UPDATE runs SET status,
 *   and the per-domain INSERT INTO agent_runs + transitionAgent loop — all
 *   run inside a single `db.transaction()`. On any throw the entire DB
 *   state rolls back to pre-dispatch (no half-built wave, no orphan
 *   agent_runs rows, no runs.status flip).
 *
 *   F-5b0996e4: filesystem-side effects split ACROSS the tx boundary, and
 *   the two halves are NOT symmetric — worktree creation (createWorktree,
 *   called inside the per-domain loop below) runs INSIDE the tx; prompt-
 *   file writes (atomicWriteFileSync, the loop after buildWave() returns)
 *   run OUTSIDE it. This corrects an earlier version of this header, which
 *   claimed BOTH were "EXPLICITLY outside the tx" — worktree creation never
 *   was; the inline note at the createWorktree call site (below) already
 *   described the true behavior ('a thrown IsolationError now propagates
 *   OUT of the surrounding db.transaction(), triggering full DB rollback.
 *   Worktrees successfully created before the failure remain on disk as FS
 *   orphans') ten lines apart from the header's contradicting claim.
 *
 *   Neither half is rolled back by a DB-tx abort: better-sqlite3 undoes SQL
 *   writes on a thrown transaction function, not filesystem writes a
 *   thrown IsolationError already performed. The trade-off: on a mid-loop
 *   IsolationError, every DB row rolls back (waves/agent_runs never
 *   existed), but worktrees already created for earlier domains in the
 *   SAME failed loop remain on disk as FS orphans — THIS is the actual
 *   source of the FS-orphan case, not the prompt loop (prompts are written
 *   only AFTER the tx has already committed, so a prompt-write failure
 *   never coincides with a DB rollback in the first place). The operator
 *   reclaims stranded worktrees with `swarm clean <run-id> --apply`, or
 *   finds any FS-orphaned prompt files from a later, successful-tx failure
 *   path with `find <outputDir> -name '*.md'` and re-dispatches. FS orphans
 *   are the better failure than a DB row that promises agents which never
 *   got their prompts.
 *
 *   Evaluated and deliberately NOT done in this pass: hoisting the
 *   createWorktree loop above buildWave() so the tx only ever INSERTs rows
 *   referencing already-created worktrees (which would make the header's
 *   original claim true, and shrink the write-lock hold time — the tx
 *   would no longer pay for N git subprocesses). Rejected here because it
 *   does not change the orphan-risk SHAPE (a hoisted loop that fails on
 *   domain K still leaves worktrees 1..K-1 on disk with no DB rows
 *   referencing them — same class of orphan, different phase) and it is a
 *   structural reorder that touches every dispatch-tx regression pin
 *   (amend2-d3b-002-dispatch-tx, dispatch-state-machine, dispatch-amend-
 *   filter, dispatch-prompt-schema) — a follow-up with its own dedicated
 *   verification pass, not a LOW-severity doc fix.
 *
 *   better-sqlite3 nests transactions cleanly — the inner
 *   `transitionAgent → executeTransition` self-wrap from Wave-A1 H9
 *   becomes a SAVEPOINT inside the outer wave-build tx.
