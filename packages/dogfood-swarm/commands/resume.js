/**
 * resume.js — `swarm resume`
 *
 * Reads agent-level state from the control plane and dispatches only incomplete work.
 * Never re-runs complete agents. Never reconstructs from disk heuristics.
 *
 * All state transitions go through the state machine. No ad-hoc status updates.
 *
 * Agent states and what resume does:
 *   complete            → skip
 *   dispatched/running  → apply timeout policy; if timed out, redispatch
 *   pending             → dispatch
 *   failed              → redispatch
 *   timed_out           → redispatch
 *   invalid_output      → BLOCKED — report, do not redispatch
 *   ownership_violation → BLOCKED — report, do not redispatch
 *
 * F-resume-wave-status — the WAVE moves with the agents. Redispatching put
 * work back in flight, so the wave row must say so: any non-`dispatched` wave
 * is transitioned to `dispatched` whenever this call redispatches at least one
 * agent, through transitionWave's override path with a `resume:` audit reason
 * (`failed` is a BLOCKED wave status; the override is how redrive/rewind/
 * revalidate already move it, and the reason prefix keeps the trail greppable
 * by intent). Pre-fix, resume left a `failed` wave `failed`, and the recovery
 * loop it advertises — "run the redispatched agent(s), then swarm collect" —
 * could not close: collect requires a `dispatched` wave and steered to
 * revalidate, which refuses agents that are not blocked. Observed live on run
 * `swarm-1787033129-beab` with schema-valid agent output already on disk.
 *
 * Zero redispatches means zero wave movement (a wave this call did not put
 * back into flight is not resume's to un-fail — see the blocked-agents case in
 * resume-collect-recovery-loop.test.js), and a wave already `dispatched` is
 * left alone rather than given a same-status audit row, because that is the
 * ordinary mid-wave timeout redispatch and the noise would bury the recoveries.
 *
 * COORD-002 — compensators table (workflow-standards NAMED_COMPENSATORS; no
 * skip allowed for an irreversible action):
 *
 *   Irreversible action: redispatching a candidate whose predecessor ran
 *   --isolate calls createWorktree() (lib/worktree.js), which does
 *   `git worktree remove <path> --force` (discards uncommitted/untracked
 *   edits) then `git branch -D` (force-deletes the branch) before
 *   recreating both fresh from HEAD.
 *
 *   Command-to-undo: NONE. Once --force proceeds over a dirty/unmerged
 *   worktree, the destroyed content is gone — untracked files never enter
 *   git's object store, so `git fsck` finds nothing to recover (this is not
 *   hypothetical: it is exactly how this wave's own prior salvage attempt
 *   was lost). There is no compensator for THIS action; the only lever is
 *   PREVENTION, which is what the guard below is. This is stated plainly
 *   per the standing rule rather than skipped.
 *
 *   Post-refusal state: nothing is touched — no DB row, no FS write. The
 *   refusal is checked and thrown before the db.transaction() below opens.
 *
 *   Owner: the operator invoking `swarm resume`. --force (opts.force) is
 *   the explicit, named escape hatch (mirrors `swarm rewind`'s
 *   --force-on-top-of---apply contract for the same blast radius); the
 *   operator accepts the loss by passing it after inspecting the named
 *   at-risk worktree(s) in the refusal error.
