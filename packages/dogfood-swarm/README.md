# @dogfood-lab/dogfood-swarm

> 10-phase parallel-agent protocol runner for testing-os. SQLite-backed control plane, durable receipts, domain-aware orchestration. Three R's recovery contract: `revalidate` / `rewind` / `redrive`.

Part of the [`testing-os`](https://github.com/dogfood-lab/testing-os) monorepo — the operating system for testing in the AI era.

The `swarm` CLI runs parallel-agent audits against a codebase. Each wave dispatches multiple agents under exclusive file ownership, collects their outputs through the verifier, and persists durable receipts to a SQLite control plane. The wave-level and agent-level state machines surface every status transition as an auditable event; the recovery verbs (`revalidate`, `rewind`, `redrive`) handle wave failures lawfully without raw SQL surgery.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @dogfood-lab/dogfood-swarm
```

Binary: `swarm`. Requires Node ≥ 22.

## Quick start

```bash
# Initialize a swarm run — drafts domains from the Atlas map when there is one, else detects them; records a save-point
swarm init <repo-path>

# Review the detected domain draft, then freeze it (dispatch refuses
# to run until the domain map is frozen)
swarm domains <run-id> --freeze

# Dispatch a wave for a named phase (NOT a wave number — phase names below)
swarm dispatch <run-id> <phase>

# (Agents execute externally — e.g., parallel Claude sessions — and write
#  their outputs to swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/<domain>/output.json)

# Collect outputs through the verifier — one --domain per dispatched agent
swarm collect <run-id> \
  --domain=backend:swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/backend/output.json \
  --domain=tests:swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/tests/output.json

# Inspect current wave + agent state
swarm status <run-id>

# Preflight the environment before dispatching (read-only checks)
swarm doctor

# Same status as a structured object for machine consumers / scripts
swarm status <run-id> --format=json

# List all runs (text), or as a JSON array of per-run rollups
swarm runs
swarm runs --format=json

# Inspect wave transition history (full audit chain)
swarm history <wave-id>

# Generate per-wave receipt artifact
swarm receipt <run-id>

# Approve findings so the next amend phase routes them to agents
# (or close them without a fix — see Finding disposition)
swarm approve <run-id> --all

# Hand a case-file to the cross-family jury — advisory evidence for the
# advance gate. Free local seats by default.
swarm adjudicate <run-id> --case-file <path>

# The stronger per-criterion tier (slower, more abstention-prone)
swarm adjudicate <run-id> --case-file <path> --jury=prism

# Advance to the next phase once gates pass
swarm advance <run-id>
```

### Collecting outputs — `--all` vs explicit `--domain`

`swarm collect` needs one agent-output path per dispatched domain. You can
hand-type them, or let `--all` auto-discover them from the deterministic
dispatch layout (`swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/<domain>/output.json`):

```text
# Auto-discover the latest dispatched wave's agent outputs
swarm collect <run-id> --all

# Equivalent explicit form (--all expands to this)
swarm collect <run-id> \
  --domain=backend:swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/backend/output.json \
  --domain=tests:swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/tests/output.json
```

`--all` reads the latest dispatched wave from the control plane and resolves
each dispatched domain's expected output path. A domain whose output file is
**missing** is a non-fatal warning — collect proceeds with the present ones,
and the absent agent is reported `failed` (re-run it, or supply its path with
`--domain`). `--all` and explicit `--domain` are **mutually exclusive**: pass
a `--domain` and it overrides `--all` (the manual path stays unchanged).

### Preflight — `swarm doctor`

Before a real dispatch, `swarm doctor` runs cheap **read-only** environment
checks and prints a structured pass/warn/fail report:

```bash
swarm doctor
```

It verifies Node ≥ 22 (the `engines.node` floor), that the control-plane
directory is writable **and** hardlink-capable (the cross-process file lock
uses `link(2)`, which exFAT/FAT32 do not support — the documented FS trap),
and that the on-disk `control-plane.db` schema is not newer than this build.
It exits non-zero **only** on a hard FAIL; warnings exit `0`.

Every other verb is scoped to a single run. `swarm trends` is the one
**cross-run** verb — it reads the data the control plane accumulates across
runs (content-addressed finding fingerprints, per-run rollups) and answers
"what keeps coming back?" Pick a query with `--query`, optionally `--format=json`:

```bash
# Findings whose fingerprint was seen in more than one run (a fix that
# regressed, or a defect class the swarm keeps re-discovering)
swarm trends --query recurring

# Per-run history, newest first — optionally filtered by repo substring
swarm trends --query history --repo my-repo

# Recurrence-rate stats over the run population (optional trailing window)
swarm trends --query recurrence --window-days 30 --format=json
```

`<phase>` is a named phase, not a wave number. The valid values are:
`health-audit-a`, `health-audit-b`, `health-audit-c`, `stage-d-audit`,
`feature-audit` (audit phases) and `health-amend-a`, `health-amend-b`,
`health-amend-c`, `stage-d-amend`, `feature-execute` (amend phases). Run
`swarm dispatch --help` for the same list.

## Recovery — the Three R's

| Verb | When to use | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `swarm revalidate` | Agents wrote `invalid_output` — schema mismatch, validator rejection | Repairs in place; transitions agent_runs out of BLOCKED status via override (with operator `--reason`); wave-level rollback if all 4 agents repaired |
| `swarm rewind` | Wave needs full restart from a save-point; tree state needs reset | Restores tree via `git reset --hard <tag>`; lawfully aborts orphaned in-flight runs to terminal `aborted_for_rewind`; preserves audit chain (append-only) |
| `swarm redrive` | Some agents failed, others completed; want to resume the failing tail without re-running completed work | Same `wave_id`, completed receipts preserved byte-identical, only failed/pending agents made re-dispatchable |

All three recovery verbs share the same operator-safety contract:

- **Dry-run by default** — `--apply` required to mutate
- **`--reason "<text>"` required, non-empty** — recorded in `wave_state_events` / `agent_state_events` with a verb-specific prefix (`revalidate:` / `rewind:` / `redrive:`)
- **Zero raw SQL on `agent_runs.status` or `waves.status`** — every state mutation routes through `transitionAgent` / `transitionWave`; static-scan guard test (Pattern #10) blocks regressions

Example session:

```bash
# Failed wave needs schema-mismatch repair (re-supply the agent's output path)
swarm revalidate <run-id> --reason "wave-2 schema mismatch corrected" \
  --domain=backend:swarms/<run-id>/wave-2/backend/output.json --apply

# Wedged wave — restart from save-point tag
swarm rewind <save-point-tag> --reason "rolling back wedged amend wave" --apply

# Transient infra failure — resume only the failed agents
swarm redrive <wave-id> --reason "GitHub API outage retry" --apply

# Audit the full transition chain for any wave
swarm history <wave-id>
```

### Reclaiming stranded worktrees — `swarm clean`

Under `--isolate` each agent works in its own git worktree, torn down when the run reaches its terminal `complete` transition. A run abandoned, rewound, or interrupted before `complete` strands those worktrees on disk. `swarm clean` is the operator reclaim — dry-run by default, like the Three R's:

```bash
# Preview the stranded worktrees + swarm/* branches for a run
swarm clean <run-id>

# Remove them
swarm clean <run-id> --apply
```

### Cleaning phantom violation claims — `swarm clean-claims`

A corrected pass (a `revalidate` repair, a fixed diff base) supersedes an earlier pass's `violation=1` file_claims rows — but once the wave is **terminal** (`advanced` / `aborted_for_rewind`), no lawful verb can revisit them: `collect` needs a `dispatched` wave, `revalidate` only repairs blocked agents on the run's latest wave, and `redrive` refuses terminal waves. The stranded rows corrupt `swarm status`'s violation count and every exported receipt for that wave. `swarm clean-claims` is the lawful reclaim: file_claims rows are *claims about what a pass observed*, not audit events — deleting a superseded claim is the lawful write, and the `agent_state_events` audit trail is never touched (the dry-run shows it as the evidence that supersedes each row).

```bash
# Preview the phantom rows + the state-event evidence that supersedes them
swarm clean-claims <run-id>

# Delete them (scoped to wave 4), with a restorable domain_events audit row
swarm clean-claims <run-id> --wave=4 --apply --reason "broken diff base superseded"
```

Rows on non-terminal waves are refused with the verb that still owns them; `violation=0` rows and other runs' rows are never touched (re-verified inside the delete transaction — a violated invariant rolls everything back).

## Exit codes

The verbs designed to gate CI propagate a machine-readable exit code, not just human-readable stdout. Wire these into a workflow step or a `&&` chain and the gate fails closed:

| Verb | Exit code contract |
|---|---|
| `swarm verify` | `0` **only** when the verdict is `pass`; `1` for every other verdict (`fail`, `skip`, `no_tests`, `tool_missing`). Each non-pass verdict is "not a verified pass" — see [Verify verdicts](#verify-verdicts) — so the machine signal matches the human one and a CI `&&` chain fails closed (a `no_tests` or `tool_missing` never reads as success). |
| `swarm verify-fixed` | `0` clean / `1` threshold exceeded (`regressed + claimed-but-still-present > --threshold`, default 0) / `2` audit pipeline broken |
| `swarm verify-recurring` | `0` / `1` / `2` (same 3-way contract as `verify-fixed`) |
| `swarm verify-unverified` | `0` / `1` / `2` (same 3-way contract) |
| `swarm verify-approved` | `0` / `1` / `2` — exit `2` (broken finding anchor) is the pre-amend gate that blocks subsequent `swarm dispatch` of an amend phase |
| `swarm adjudicate` | `0` **only** when the overall jury verdict is `corroborate`; `1` for every other verdict (`refute`, `contested`, `insufficient_context`) — the same pass-only-exit-0 contract as `swarm verify`, so a CI `&&` chain fails closed. The verdict is **advisory**, and this exit code is not the wave gate: what a non-corroborate blocks is the adjudication gate in `swarm advance`, which is Director-overridable. See [Adjudication](#adjudication). |
| `swarm findings` | `0` clean / `1` findings present / `2` audit pipeline broken |
| `swarm persist --ingest` | `0` when the dogfood ingest succeeded (or was a `--dry-run`); `1` when the ingest failed. A bare `swarm persist` with no `--ingest` exits `0`. |

Any command also exits `1` on a structured operator error (the typed `code` / `message` / `Next:` envelope). Exit `2` is reserved for the "pipeline broken" case on the verbs above so a CI gate can tell *findings/regressions exist* (1) apart from *the audit itself could not run* (2).

## Troubleshooting — when a wave fails

Every command emits its stage transitions as **NDJSON on stderr**, so the first move in an incident is to capture that forensic stream and read it back:

```bash
swarm collect <run-id> \
  --domain=backend:swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/backend/output.json 2>collect.ndjson
grep '"stage"' collect.ndjson   # the ordered chain of what happened, with codes
```

Then map the symptom to the recovery verb:

| Symptom | What it means | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `collect` failed mid-upsert (`COLLECT_UPSERT_FAILED`) | One agent's output failed validation or the merge transaction aborted; the wave is `failed`. | `swarm revalidate <run-id> --reason "..." --domain=name:path --apply` — re-runs the same validators on the re-supplied output, and on pass flips the wave back to `collected` in one transaction. |
| Wave stuck in `dispatched` — never reached `collected` | Agents didn't all finish, or the run was interrupted before `collect`. | First look, don't act: `swarm status <run-id>` marks overdue agents `[STALE]`, and `swarm resume <run-id> --dry-run` reports exactly what a resume would time out and redispatch — both write nothing. Then `swarm resume <run-id>` to re-dispatch the incomplete agents; or `swarm redrive <wave-id> --reason "..." --apply` to resume only the failed/unstarted tail while preserving completed receipts byte-identical. |
| Agents look stuck and you want to know if they're alive | `swarm resume` is **not** a liveness probe — applying the timeout policy transitions overdue agents to `timed_out`, which redispatches them. Asking the question mutates the answer. | `swarm status <run-id>` (overdue rows render `[STALE — past timeout policy]`) or `swarm resume <run-id> --dry-run`. Both share the same timeout predicate as the mutating pass, so a preview cannot disagree with the outcome. |
| Agents `BLOCKED` (`invalid_output` / `ownership_violation`) | Schema mismatch, or an agent wrote outside its frozen domain. | `invalid_output` → `swarm revalidate`. `ownership_violation` → extend the domain via `swarm domains --unfreeze … --edit … --freeze`, then `swarm revalidate`. |
| Wave wedged — tree state needs a full reset | The working tree drifted and the wave must restart from a save-point. | `swarm rewind <save-point-tag> --reason "..." --apply` — `git reset --hard <tag>` plus lawful abort of orphaned in-flight runs, audit chain preserved. |
| `swarm status` / `swarm receipt` report violations on a wave that already **advanced** clean | Stale `violation=1` file_claims from a superseded pass (a revalidate repair or corrected diff base) stranded on a terminal wave — collect/revalidate/redrive can no longer reach them. | `swarm clean-claims <run-id>` to preview the phantom rows + superseding evidence, then `--apply --reason "..."` to delete them with a restorable `domain_events` audit row. |

Most recovery verbs — `revalidate`, `rewind`, `redrive`, `clean`, `clean-claims` — are **dry-run by default**: run them without `--apply` first to preview the transitions, then add `--apply`.

**`resume` is the exception, and it is the one that catches people.** It mutates by default and has no `--apply` gate, because redispatching is its whole job. Preview it with `swarm resume <run-id> --dry-run` (opt-in, not the default — flipping the default would silently break every script that already calls the bare verb expecting it to act).

The wave moves with the agents. When `resume` redispatches at least one agent on a wave that is not already `dispatched` — a `failed` wave, most often — it returns the wave to `dispatched` in the same transaction, audited in `wave_state_events` with a `resume:` reason. That is what makes its own closing instruction ("run the redispatched agent(s), then `swarm collect`") true, since `collect` requires a `dispatched` wave. A resume that redispatches nothing leaves the wave exactly as it found it.

Every error carries a typed `code` and a `Next:` hint; the full table is in the handbook.

## State machines

Two parallel state machines:

- **Agent runs** (`lib/state-machine.js`): `pending → dispatched → running → complete | failed | timed_out | invalid_output | ownership_violation | aborted_for_rewind`
- **Waves** (`lib/wave-state-machine.js`): `dispatched → collected → verified → advanced | failed | aborted_for_rewind`

Discipline:

- **Terminal statuses** (`complete`, `advanced`, `aborted_for_rewind`) cannot be transitioned out of — not even with `override=true`.
- **BLOCKED statuses** (`failed`, `invalid_output`, `ownership_violation`) require explicit `override=true` + non-empty `reason` to transition out.
- Every transition lands in `wave_state_events` / `agent_state_events` **atomically** with the underlying status mutation, inside the same SQLite transaction.

## Verify verdicts

`swarm verify <run-id>` runs the build-verification adapter and prints `Verification: <VERDICT>`. Only `pass` advances the wave to `verified` — the other four verdicts are deliberately distinct so a no-op never masquerades as a clean pass:

| Verdict | Means | Advances the wave? |
|---|---|---|
| `pass` | Every required step ran and passed. | Yes |
| `fail` | A required step ran and failed — the code is broken. | No |
| `skip` | No required steps ran (every step was optional or filtered away). Nothing was verified. | No |
| `no_tests` | The repo has no `test` script; `npm test --if-present` ran zero tests. **Not** a verified pass — supply a real test command via a step override or pick an explicit `--adapter`. | No |
| `tool_missing` | A required tool (e.g. `npm`, `npx`) is absent from `PATH`, so verification could not run in this environment. **Not** a failure of the code under test — install the tool or run on a host that has it. | No |

`no_tests` and `tool_missing` exist precisely so the wave gate stays honest: it refuses to advance without positive evidence, but it does not falsely report `FAIL` when the cause is a missing test script or a missing build tool rather than a real regression.

## Adjudication

`swarm adjudicate <run-id> --case-file <path>` hands a neutral case-file to a jury of **non-Claude** models and fuses their per-criterion answers into one overall verdict. The panel is family-different by construction — the crew that produces the work under test is Claude-family, so only a non-Claude jury is an independent check, and the producing family never holds a seat.

Two tiers sit behind the same boundary:

- **`--jury=local`** (default) — one model call per seat, over all criteria. Free, fast, family-diverse.
- **`--jury=prism`** — one prism verification *per criterion* (four decorrelated lenses, with collapse-refusal). Stronger per-criterion evidence, bought with wall clock and a higher abstention rate.

`--cloud` opts either tier into the paid cloud seats. `PRISM_PYTHON` selects the interpreter that runs the prism seat shim — see [Environment variables](#environment-variables).

The verdict is **evidence, not law**:

| Overall | Means | `swarm advance` gate |
|---|---|---|
| `corroborate` | The panel agrees the artifact meets its criteria. | Passes |
| `refute` | The panel decided a criterion is unmet. | Blocks — overridable |
| `contested` | The panel split. Genuine disagreement, surfaced rather than averaged away. | Blocks — overridable |
| `insufficient_context` | The panel could not reach quorum — a gap in the brief to fill, **not** a fail. | Blocks — overridable |

Only the deterministic floor (`swarm verify` — the real tests, plus the `atlas-check` step and the structural delta in a repository with an Atlas map) is law. A delta that adds an import between parts, closes a cycle, or adds a writer to a place blocks `swarm advance` on the `atlas_delta` gate until a person disposes of it with `--override --reason`. A `corroborate` does not advance a wave on its own; a wave that never ran the jury advances on the floor plus findings; and a non-corroborate blocks *overridably*, requiring a Director disposition (`swarm advance --override --reason "..."`) so the verdict is consciously dispositioned rather than silently rolled past.

📖 Both tiers side by side, the honest boundary of the prism tier, and the case-file neutrality rules: **[The two jury tiers](https://github.com/dogfood-lab/testing-os/blob/main/docs/case-file-contract.md#the-two-jury-tiers)**

## Finding disposition

An open `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` finding blocks the severity gate on the finding-gated phases (`health-audit-a`, `health-audit-b`, `health-audit-c`, `stage-d-audit`) until it reaches a closed status: `fixed`, `deferred`, or `rejected`. Lower severities never block that gate — a `MEDIUM` or `LOW` can stay open across an advance.

Three verbs act on an open finding:

| Verb | What it does | Closes the finding? |
|---|---|---|
| `swarm approve` | Routes it to the next amend phase for an agent to fix. | Not by itself — the amend's fix is what marks it `fixed` |
| `swarm defer` | Accepted and postponed: a real defect, but not this wave. | Yes, without a fix |
| `swarm reject` | Not a defect: the finding itself is wrong. | Yes, without a fix |

"The amend's fix is what marks it `fixed`" is mechanical, not aspirational: when `swarm collect` accepts an amend agent as `complete`, the agent's `fixes[]` declarations close the approved findings they name — status `fixed`, `closure_kind='declared'`, `verified_how='self_attested'`, one `finding_events` row naming the wave, the agent, and the declaring domain (observed missing in run swarm-1784601601-bd4a, where amended findings stayed `approved` forever and later audit lenses swept them to `unverified`). The declaration is gated by the same one-rule authority as routing and vouching: only `approved` findings the declaring domain owns (glob match on the file, `filed_by_domain` for file-less rows) can close; unknown, unowned, and non-approved ids are skipped loudly on the collect report. The closure is self-attested by design — `swarm verify-fixed` is the independent pass that audits every `fixed` row afterwards.

```bash
# Approve every open finding, or a subset by id
swarm approve <run-id> --all
swarm approve <run-id> --ids F-001,F-002

# Close without a fix — targeted only, --reason required
swarm defer <run-id> --ids F-001,F-002 --reason "accepted; scheduled for v2"
swarm reject <run-id> --ids F-001,F-002 --reason "false positive — the guard is upstream"
```

`defer` and `reject` are deliberately targeted: there is no `--all`, and a non-empty `--reason` is mandatory. The reason lands in the append-only `finding_events` log in the same transaction as the status flip, so a finding closed without a fix always carries the operator's justification. Both are idempotent — an already-closed finding is skipped rather than re-evented.

### Reopening a wrongly-closed finding — `swarm reopen`

`approve`/`defer`/`reject` only ever move an *open* finding to a closed status — none of them can undo a mistaken closure. `swarm reopen` is the lawful undo: it moves a `fixed`, `deferred`, or `rejected` finding back to `recurring` (open, amendable again). Like the recovery verbs below, it is dry-run by default; `--apply` is required to mutate, and it previews exactly which findings are eligible before you consent:

```bash
# Preview only
swarm reopen <run-id> --ids F-001,F-002 --reason "the fix regressed" --evidence "repro script attached, fails again on main"

# Apply
swarm reopen <run-id> --ids F-001,F-002 --reason "the fix regressed" --evidence "repro script attached, fails again on main" --apply
```

Both `--reason` and `--evidence` are mandatory (a reason without evidence is not enough to reopen settled history). There is no `--all` — reopening a run's entire closed history in one keystroke is out of scope. The prior closure's `finding_events` row is never touched; reopening writes a new, additional `reopened` event, so the full history — closed once, reopened, why — stays intact.

### Operator-closing a finding — `swarm close`

Some findings are structurally unclosable by the normal amend path — an unowned file no domain's globs cover, or a Director-directed disposal. `swarm close` is the operator-closure verb for exactly that case. It only supports `--as fixed` (deferring/rejecting stay the standalone `swarm defer`/`swarm reject` verbs above — `close` does not duplicate them), and it requires `--verified-how` naming how the fix was actually verified:

```bash
swarm close <run-id> --ids F-001,F-002 \
  --reason "file is unowned by any domain; fixed out-of-band" \
  --evidence "PR #42 on the upstream repo" \
  --verified-how independent \
  --apply
```

`--verified-how` is one of `independent` (someone other than the fixer verified it), `self_attested` (the fixer's own claim, unverified by anyone else), or `operator_evidence` (the Director's own direct evidence) — it is mandatory, not optional, since it is the field that predicts whether a closure holds or reopens later.

### Coordinator-resolved closure — `swarm resolve`

The dispatch banner for unrouted approved findings has always named a recovery path: land the fix yourself, then attach `coordinator_resolved: true` plus a one-line `verified_via_evidence` so `swarm verify-fixed` classifies the closure as **allowlist** (operator-attested) instead of unverifiable. `swarm resolve` is that path as a verb — before it, the columns were reachable only by editing the database directly, which left zero `finding_events` rows (observed in run swarm-1784601601-bd4a: 16 hand-closed rows, no audit trail):

```bash
swarm resolve <run-id> --ids F-001,F-002 \
  --evidence "fix landed in commit abc123; package suite green" \
  --apply
```

It closes open rows as `fixed` and persists `coordinator_resolved=1` + `verified_via_evidence=<--evidence>` on the row — the exact columns `swarm verify-fixed`'s allowlist channel reads — plus `closure_kind='operator'`, `verified_how='operator_evidence'`, and one `finding_events` row per closure. `--reason` is optional (the evidence doubles as the reason); dry-run by default, `--apply` to mutate. Where `swarm close` records how *you* verified a fix, `resolve` *is* the evidence-carrying attestation.

## Control plane

SQLite-backed. Each swarm run gets `swarms/<run-id>/control-plane.db`:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `waves` | Wave records (status, phase, wave_number, run_id, snapshot, serial_verify_required) |
| `agent_runs` | Per-agent dispatch records (status, domain, output_path, verification_skipped) |
| `wave_state_events` | Append-only wave-status audit log (from_status, to_status, reason, created_at) |
| `agent_state_events` | Append-only agent-status audit log (mirror shape of wave_state_events) |
| `findings` | Findings derived from agent outputs |
| `domain_events` | Domain-map mutation audit log (unfreeze / edit / freeze), plus the restorable `file_claims_cleaned` audit rows written by `swarm clean-claims --apply` |

Read via `swarm status`, `swarm history`, `swarm receipt`. Never via raw SQL in scripts — the state-machine helpers are the supported interface and the audit chain depends on going through them.

## Trajectory layer — `swarm roadmap`

A single run's findings/receipts are durable, but nothing carried *forward*: a second swarm run against the same repo started cold, re-discovering the same hotspots the last run already found. `swarm roadmap` closes that gap with a **compiled, never authored** artifact — every section is a query against the control-plane DB and git, run fresh at compile time, plus a small, bounded set of human-authored operator notes.

```bash
# Compile the trajectory artifact for a completed run
swarm roadmap compile <run-id>

# Read the latest (or a specific --version) compiled roadmap
swarm roadmap show <run-id>
swarm roadmap show <run-id> --version=2
```

What gets compiled: open/deferred/approved findings, the grandfathered/deferred-findings drain queue, recurrence stats, and a per-file **attention list** — labeled `ADVISORY — NOT A GATE` in every render, because it is a transparent heuristic (recent churn × prior-finding recency × cross-domain fragmentation) meant to focus a *human's* attention, never to gate, predict, or auto-blame a wave or a domain.

Operator notes are the only hand-authored part: at most 7, each a `theme`, an `open-question`, or an `invariant`. An `invariant` note must name an `enforced_by` gate or test file that actually exists on disk — a lesson with no mechanical verifier behind it is refused at compile time rather than silently accepted as an unenforced promise. Notes past their `expires` date are dropped from the compile, but listed as `EXPIRED` in the output — never silently disappeared.

Each `compile` is versioned; recompiling a run supersedes with a new sequence number rather than overwriting history.

## Environment variables

Seven environment variables are part of the scriptable surface:

| Variable | Accepted values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SWARM_DB` | a filesystem path | Overrides the control-plane DB path. Unset → the default `swarms/<run-id>/control-plane.db`. Point this at a non-default DB to run against an alternate control plane. |
| `SWARM_VERIFY_MAX_BUFFER_BYTES` | a positive integer (bytes) | Overrides the default 64 MB `execFileSync` stdout+stderr capture ceiling for every `swarm verify` step. Unset → the module default. Set it above a failing step's reported byte count when its own output legitimately exceeds 64 MB (mirrors `step.maxBufferBytes` for programmatic callers). |
| `SWARM_VERIFY_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS` | a positive integer (milliseconds) | Overrides the per-step wall-clock timeout `swarm verify` gives each adapter step (the test run, the build). Unset → the adapter default. Set it when a suite legitimately runs longer than the default — a 7,500-test suite on a shared rig needed 900000 — rather than splitting the suite; a step that exceeds it is a FAIL receipt naming the timeout, never a hung verify. |
| `DOGFOOD_FINDINGS_FORMAT` | `raw` \| `human` \| `json` | Forces the `swarm findings` output format, overriding both the `--format` flag and TTY auto-detection. `raw` → markdown, `human` → text, `json` → JSON. |
| `DOGFOOD_LOG_HUMAN` | `0` \| `1` | Controls the human-readable companion banner printed alongside the NDJSON stage stream on **stderr**. `0` → never emit the banner (deterministic machine-readable stderr for CI), `1` → always emit it. Unset → emit only when stderr is a TTY. |
| `INGEST_REPO_ROOT` | a filesystem path | Overrides the **data root** the dogfood ingest writes to when `swarm persist --ingest` (or `persist-results.js`) shells out to `packages/ingest/run.js`. Unset → the real repo root (the live `records/` + `indexes/` corpus). Point it at a scratch dir to ingest without touching the real tree — the test suite sets it so ingest stays side-effect-free. |
| `PRISM_PYTHON` | a path to a Python interpreter | Selects the interpreter that runs the prism seat shim for `swarm adjudicate --jury=prism`. Unset → `python` on `PATH`. Set it to a full path when `python` is absent, ambiguous, or is not the interpreter that has `prism-verify` installed (the Windows PATHEXT trap). Ignored by the default `--jury=local` tier, which makes no prism calls. |

Stage transitions are emitted as **NDJSON on stderr** — one JSON object per line, greppable — while stdout carries the command's parse target. Set `DOGFOOD_LOG_HUMAN=0` when you want a clean, machine-parseable stderr stream (e.g. `swarm collect ... 2>collect.ndjson`).

## 10-phase protocol

| Phase | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 1–4 (Health Pass) | Audit → Review → Amend → Repeat. Three stages: A (bug/security fix), B (proactive health), C (humanization), D (visual/presentation truth). Closes at 0 CRIT / 0 HIGH. |
| 5–8 (Feature Pass) | Feature audit → user review → execution → repeat. Production-readiness focus. |
| 9 | Final test pass — comprehensive validation across the whole system. |
| 10 | Full Treatment — shipcheck, README finalize + translations, landing page, handbook, repo-knowledge DB entry, deploy + verify. |

Each wave produces a manifest (`swarms/<run-id>/manifest.json`) and per-wave receipts (`swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/receipt.md`) for durable audit. A swarm is **not complete** until Phase 10 finishes.

## Domain ownership

Agents in a wave have exclusive file ownership scoped to their domain. In a repository with an Atlas map the domains are unions of its parts, named after the largest (`swarm init` drafts them; `--no-atlas`, `--domains <n>`, `--tests-domain` and `swarm domains --from-atlas` adjust the draft), and freezing runs `atlas check` on the map; without a map the typical domains are backend, bridge, tests, ci-tooling, frontend and docs. The frozen domain map at dispatch time is the canonical authority; the agent prompt is derived from the frozen state so dispatch + agent + verifier all consume the same shape.

Cross-domain mutation surfaces at collect time as status `ownership_violation` (BLOCKED). Recovery options:

- `swarm domains --unfreeze --reason "..." → --edit <domain> --globs "..." → --freeze` — to legitimately extend a domain's scope (recorded in `domain_events`)
- `swarm revalidate` — if the agent's `files_changed` self-report turns out to match the original frozen scope after coordinator review

## Save-point discipline

The repo's git tags + commits ARE the save points. Commits on `main` are the durable mechanism for "I can roll back to here." `swarm rewind` accepts any git tag matching `swarm-save-*` by default (`--force-arbitrary-ref` opts into any ref). Rewind is dry-run safe; verified by an explicit HEAD-guard test that confirms the actual repo's HEAD is unchanged after the rewind test suite runs (cordoned-test discipline).
