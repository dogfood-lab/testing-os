/**
 * reason-escaping-discipline.test.js — mechanical guard against a NEW
 * reason-rendering site shipping unescaped.
 *
 * The wave-18 root cause (F-7c3e91a4 / F-463c7179): wave 16 fixed
 * formatOverrideGroups (cli.js) alone, while seven near-identical sibling
 * call sites (history.js, status.js, rewind.js, redrive.js, revalidate.js,
 * clean-claims.js x2) shipped zero escaping — undetected for two full
 * waves until an auditor's live CLI-subprocess repro found them by hand.
 * That is exactly the failure mode a mechanical, always-on gate exists to
 * catch instead of relying on the next auditor to find it again.
 *
 * Scans every commands/*.js file + cli.js for the bare identifiers this
 * package uses for operator-audit reason text (`reason`, `reasonRecorded`,
 * `lastReason` — the fields wave_state_events.reason / agent_state_events.
 * reason / domain_events.reason and the --reason CLI flag itself all funnel
 * through these names) and requires that any file touching one of them ALSO
 * references escapeReasonForDisplay somewhere in its source, unless
 * explicitly allowlisted below with a named, reviewable justification.
 *
 * SCOPE, STATED PLAINLY (mirrors amend1-wave9-filter-discipline.test.js's
 * own convention of naming a static scanner's boundary rather than
 * overclaiming it): this is a FILE-level co-occurrence check, not a
 * per-line or per-function one. It reliably catches the wave-18 regression
 * SHAPE — an entire file/call-site landing with zero escaping calls
 * anywhere in it, the actual historical defect — but would NOT catch a new
 * unescaped line added to a file that already legitimately calls
 * escapeReasonForDisplay elsewhere for a DIFFERENT site. The companion
 * wave18-4091637-5127-swarm-cp-pins.test.js file has call-site-precise
 * CLI-subprocess proofs for the sites that exist today; this gate is the
 * class-level trip-wire for tomorrow's new site landing with NO escaping
 * call anywhere in its file — the exact shape of gap that let wave 18's
 * seven siblings through undetected. A future maintainer who wants
 * per-call-site precision should extend this file, not silently trust the
 * coarser check; the allowlist below is INTENTIONALLY narrow and forces a
 * documented decision on every file the sweep flags, which is the same
 * "forces a thinking step" discipline amend1-wave9-filter-discipline.test.js
 * established for its own domain.

// F-7ef099e3 (wave 22): the commands/verify.js entry that used to sit here

// argument wave 19/20's own F-5d330a4f / F-4773fb77 findings corrected:
// probe.reason is NOT "verifier-computed diagnostic text" in the safe
// sense that entry implied — it embeds the AUDITED TARGET REPO's own
// manifest `name` field verbatim (node.js/rust.js's probe()), reachable at
// zero operator privilege, which is exactly WHY verify.js now calls
// escapeReasonForDisplay on result.probe.reason (verify.js:254) and
// p.reason (verify.js:286). The entry was already inert before this
// removal — verify.js independently satisfies this gate's own
// `stripped.includes(ESCAPE_CALL)` check via those two real calls, so the
// allowlist text was never actually consulted by the running check — but a
// dead entry with an inverted safety argument is a foot-gun for the next
// maintainer who searches this array for prior art, not documentation.
// Leaving wrong text in place is strictly worse than no entry at all.
//
// F-6c030425 (wave 24): the SAME dead-entry shape independently resurfaced in
// THREE more entries after the fix above was applied to only the one
// instance in front of it — this repo's own most expensive lesson
// (swarms/PROTOCOL.md "Fixing a class, not an instance"). All three are
// REMOVED here, not reworded, for the identical reason verify.js's entry was
// removed rather than corrected: a dead entry a future maintainer might
// search for prior art is worse than no entry at all. (F-7214a8aa, wave 26:
// this passage previously named only resume.js and persist.js and said "TWO
// more entries" / "Both are REMOVED" — commands/adjudicate.js's entry was
// also removed in this same commit and was never mentioned here; see the
// third bullet below.)
//
//   - commands/resume.js (was here): independently re-verified —
//     resume.js:466 calls `escapeReasonForDisplay(a.error)` (a DIFFERENT
//     identifier than the allowlisted `report.reason`), so this file's own
//     `stripped.includes(ESCAPE_CALL)` check already passes before the
//     allowlist is ever consulted. The removed entry's TEXT was accurate
//     (report.reason really is a computed action-classifier string built
//     entirely from counts/statuses, e.g. "Some agents not complete — run
//     `swarm resume`" — never operator free text) — it was dead, not wrong.
//
//   - commands/persist.js (was here): independently re-verified —
//     persist.js:183 calls `escapeReasonForDisplay(r.dogfood?.reason)`,
//     escaping the EXACT field this entry allowlisted, so the same
//     dead-before-consultation shape applies. This one's text was ALSO
//     wrong — a second, independent defect, not just dead code: it claimed
//     r.dogfood.reason is "the dogfood-ingest HTTP/API rejection reason",
//     but persist.js never makes an HTTP/API call; it shells out locally via
//     execFileSync (persist.js:102), and on a failed ingest r.dogfood.reason
//     is a Node child_process error `.message` (persist.js's own
//     F-bf28b667/wave-20 comment says so a few lines above the real escape
//     call). F-bbb69043 already flagged this exact text as a
//     mischaracterization; `git log --oneline -- <this file>` shows only two
//     commits ever touched it (132dc18 wave-18 creation, 40e3d47 wave-22's
//     verify.js removal) — the wrong text was simply never revisited.
//
//   - commands/adjudicate.js (was here): independently re-verified — this
//     same wave's F-0b7ba713 fix gave the file its own, unrelated
//     escapeReasonForDisplay call (adjudicate.js:60 imports it;
//     adjudicate.js:302 calls `escapeReasonForDisplay(o.finding)` for the
//     jury's out_of_brief text), so this file's own
//     `stripped.includes(ESCAPE_CALL)` check already passes before the
//     allowlist is ever consulted — the identical dead-before-consultation
//     shape as the two entries above, just reached by a fix landing in this
//     SAME commit rather than a prior wave. The removed entry's TEXT was
//     accurate (the one `reason` occurrence really was literal usage-hint
//     text inside a help string naming the --reason CLI flag for the
//     operator to type next, not an interpolated/rendered VALUE) — it was

// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Audited-controlled field-family gate: file_path / file / line / line_number
// / symbol / out_of_brief / (finding-shaped) description.
//
// Coordinator-assigned, wave 24 — the class fix behind this wave's 4 HIGH
// findings. HANDOFF.md's wave-22 debt disclosure named this gap directly:
// "the escaping-discipline gate's REASON_IDENTIFIER regex is structurally
// blind to the file/file-path field family — the field family has direct
// pinned coverage, but the FILE-level gate won't catch a *future* new render
// site." verbs + core are escaping ~10 render/prompt sites of this family
// this wave (commands/dispatch.js, commands/adjudicate.js, cli.js,
// lib/findings-render.js, lib/templates.js) because wave 22 fixed the class
// in two lanes (the ownership/file_claims family via escapePathForDisplay,
// F-f1dae277) and still left these siblings. This section is the standing
// gate so the NEXT sibling is caught mechanically instead of by the next
// confirming audit.
//
// Why this is a SEPARATE gate from REASON_IDENTIFIER above, not a widened
// version of it: the reason-family check is FILE-level ("does
// escapeReasonForDisplay appear ANYWHERE in the file") because the wave-18
// defect it was built for really was file-shaped — whole files shipping zero
// escaping. That granularity is PROVABLY too coarse for this field family:
// lib/findings-render.js already calls escapeReasonForDisplay (via its own
// truncate() helper, used for `description`/`evidence`) in the SAME file as
// a genuinely unescaped `loc` (built from `f.file`/`f.line`) and `f.symbol`
// render. A file-level check sees the pre-existing call and marks the WHOLE
// FILE clean, silently exempting the sites next to it — confirmed by
// actually running a bare file-level version of this check against this
// package's real source before choosing this design: it reported
// lib/findings-render.js clean while 7 of its lines were genuinely
// unescaped. So this gate is scoped PER-LINE, and its allowlist is keyed by
// a content anchor (a literal substring of the offending line) rather than a
// line number — the same reason the grandfather-manifest gate is
// content-addressed via a SHA-256 digest (EXPECTED_GRANDFATHER_MANIFEST_HASH
// / grandfatherManifestFingerprint, scripts/check-finding-regression-pins.mjs)
// rather than guarded by a headcount (PROTOCOL.md "Fixing a class, not an
// instance", sub-law 5; F-2e4c3017, wave 26: this comment previously cited a
// never-existed `dispatch.lock.json` file — no such file exists anywhere in
// this repo, tracked or otherwise): a line-number key silently stops
// matching, or silently keeps "protecting" the wrong line, the moment an
// unrelated edit shifts the file.
//
// Scope, stated plainly (same discipline as REASON_IDENTIFIER's own SCOPE
// paragraph above):
//   - every identifier requires a PRECEDING DOT (`\.file_path\b`, not bare
//     `\bfile_path\b`). A SQL column alias inside a query string
//     (`fc.file_path`) and this gate's real target (`f.file_path`
//     interpolated into a console/markdown line) are lexically identical —
//     both are dotted access — so the dot alone cannot separate them.
//   - what DOES separate them, measured (not assumed) against this
//     package's real source: every genuine render site interpolates the
//     value with `${...}`; every SQL alias / DB bind param / dedup-key
//     construction in this package never does — queries are parameterized
//     with `?`, never string-built via template interpolation of a column
//     value. Requiring a `${` co-occurrence on the SAME line eliminated
//     every false positive measured (verify-approved.js / verify-recurring
//     .js / verify-unverified.js's column-alias SELECTs; cli.js's
//     annotateCanonicalFindingIds tupleKey/driftedLineKey dedup keys;
//     clean-claims.js / receipt.js's intermediate claim/violation model
//     objects) while keeping every real render site intact (verified by
//     direct measurement — see the per-line ALLOWLIST below for the
//     disposition of every line this scan actually flagged).
//   - `description` deliberately stays a BARE dotted identifier
//     (`\.description\b`), not scoped to a specific receiver name, because
//     the real sibling this sweep found (cli.js:2636, `swarm trends --query
//     recurring`) renders finding.description through a receiver named `r`,
//     not `f` — a receiver allowlist would have silently missed it. The word
//     also collides with a materially different, lower-privilege field —
//     `swarm domains`'s own `domain.description` (operator/repo-owner-
//     authored config, not audited-target-repo content) at commands/status.js
//     and cli.js's `--desc` domain-edit flag — but both of those measured
//     false positives are ALREADY excluded by the `${` requirement above
//     (neither renders via template interpolation anywhere in this package,
//     confirmed by reading both call sites), so no separate receiver
//     restriction is needed, and one was tried and REMOVED here after it
//     proved to silently exclude the real cli.js:2636 sibling — the fix
//     traded a false negative for an unneeded guard against a false positive
//     the `${` check already handled. Left as a disclosed near-miss rather
//     than silently corrected, per this repo's own "an honest partial beats
//     an overclaim" standard.
//   - like the gate above, this is source-text scanning, not a real parser:
//     a render site that concatenated with `+` instead of interpolating with
//     `${...}` would slip through. Every render site in this package today
//     uses template-literal interpolation (verified by reading every flagged
//     line, not assumed) — if that convention ever changes, this gate's `${`
//     requirement needs to change with it. Disclosed, not silently papered
//     over (swarms/CLAUDE.md "Honesty is a feature of the artifact").
//
// A note on the wave-24 parallel-amend shape (constraint (c) of this gate's
// own dispatch brief): swarm-cp-verbs and swarm-cp-core are escaping their
// named sites in ISOLATED worktrees this same wave, invisible to this
// worktree's copy of the source. This gate is authored to be correct against
// a FULLY ESCAPED tree — it is expected to fail here, in THIS worktree,
// against every site those lanes haven't landed yet. That is the gate
// working, not a bug in it: the coordinator's serial verify (after merging
// every lane) is where this gate gets to actually prove something. Any
// failure it reports that ISN'T one of the sites those two lanes are known
// to be fixing this wave is a genuinely new sibling — see the next
// paragraph.
//
// A sibling this sweep independently found — and this same wave went on to
// fix, not previously named by this wave's routed findings: `swarm trends
// --query recurring`'s formatTrends() rendered `r.description` unescaped —
// `r` here comes from lib/queries/cross-run-analytics.js's
// queryRecurringFindings(), whose SQL selects `MAX(f.description) AS
// description` directly off the `findings` table — the SAME field family,
// reached via a query path (cross-run trend aggregation) none of this
// wave's other named sites touch. This is the gate catching a real gap on
// its own first run, not a false positive: cli.js:2636 now reads
// `escapeReasonForDisplay(r.description)` under an explicit "F-c6f7d8fc
// (wave 24) sweep" comment. (F-1a36730d, wave 26: this passage, the failure
// message below, and a mutation-proof test's inline comment all previously
// described this site as still-open and un-allowlisted "on purpose" — true
// pre-merge, in this domain's own isolated wave-24 worktree per the
// parallel-amend note above, but never reconciled after the merge landed
// the fix in the same commit. See HANDOFF.md's wave-24 entry, which already
// correctly frames this as "a 9th and 10th site the sweep found beyond the
// audit's".)

// This package has TWO legitimate escaping primitives for TWO different
// render surfaces, and this gate recognizes both:
//   - TERMINAL / markdown-to-a-human surface → escapeReasonForDisplay /
//     escapePathForDisplay (the full pass: backslash + quote + newline +
//     the invisible/bidi/Tag-block CONTROL_CLASS + ZALGO_RUN). A terminal
//     render needs the newline/quote passes because an embedded newline
//     forges a whole fake line on a console (the wave-16→22 history in
//     commands/lib/escape-reason.js).
//   - PROMPT surface (text handed to the NEXT agent as its prompt) →
//     neutralizeInvisibleControls, the core-lane primitive added this wave
//     (wave 24) alongside the existing two in commands/lib/escape-reason.js.
//     It applies ONLY the invisible/Tag-block/bidi CONTROL_CLASS + ZALGO_RUN
//     passes and deliberately OMITS the backslash/quote/newline passes:
//     those would mangle legitimate agent-read prompt prose and fight
//     lib/templates.js's fenceSafeBlock (which owns the backtick-fence
//     hazard on that surface). The real injection risk on an LLM-read prompt
//     is the invisible/steganography/bidi class (ASCII-smuggling via the Tag
//     block, bidi override, zero-width) — exactly what the neutralizer
//     strips — not newline forgery, which has no meaning to a prompt reader.
//
// SCOPE BOUNDARY, stated plainly (same honesty standard as this file's other
// disclosed boundaries): this is a same-line "was SOME recognized escaping
