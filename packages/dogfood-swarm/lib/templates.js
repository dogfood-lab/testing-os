/**
 * templates.js — Agent prompt generation from domain map + phase.
 *
 * Generates ready-to-use prompts for each domain agent in a wave.
 * Templates embed: repo path, domain scope, file list, phase lens, output format.
 *
 * Authority discipline (Stage B Item 1 + Item 4):
 * The output-shape contract appended to every prompt is DERIVED FROM the
 * canonical agent-output schema (@dogfood-lab/schemas) — not hand-typed
 * parallel to it. The
 * worked-example JSON below the contract block stays as a worked example,
 * but the schema fragment is the load-bearing reference. Same root-cause
 * group as Item 4: brief-vs-frozen-state parallel authority. Pact-style
 * contract test in dispatch-prompt-schema.test.js asserts the schema
 * fragment is present in every generated prompt.
 *
 * F-d2d06af3 (HIGH, wave 24): buildAmendPrompt (line ~524) interpolates
 * `f.file_path`/`f.description`/`f.recommendation` — audit-agent-authored
 * text describing a (sometimes-adversarial) target repo, the same
 * zero-privilege origin F-f1dae277 and F-c3d8fd7e already established for
 * this field family elsewhere in this package — with ZERO escaping for
 * `file_path` and only `fenceSafe`'s backtick-fence-parity guard for
 * `description`/`recommendation`. buildAuditPrompt's `opts.priorContext`
 * (the joined prior-findings block commands/dispatch.js hands it) has the
 * identical gap through `fenceSafeBlock`. Neither `fenceSafe` nor
 * `fenceSafeBlock` touch the control-byte/bidi/Tag-block class at all — they
 * exist solely to keep a stray backtick run from breaking THIS document's
 * own Markdown fence structure. The generated prompt is written to
 * `swarms/<run>/wave-N/<domain>.md` and read VERBATIM as the next wave's
 * Sonnet agent's own operating instructions, with no human review step in
 * between — a more direct injection surface than any terminal transcript
 * this package has already hardened, and the exact paradigm case
 * commands/lib/escape-reason.js's own F-6540ba3d docblock names as the
 * highest-risk audience (Graves 2026, arXiv:2603.00164: the Tag-block
 * ASCII-Smuggling primitive is decoded PREFERENTIALLY BY ANTHROPIC MODELS).
 *
 * THE FIX IS DELIBERATELY NOT `escapeReasonForDisplay`: that escaper is
 * built for a QUOTED TERMINAL surface — it doubles backslashes, escapes
 * double-quotes, and renders `\n`/`\t` as visible two-character markers.
 * Applied to a PROMPT an agent reads as prose/instructions, that would
 * mangle ordinary quoted text and paths (a Windows path's backslashes would
 * double) and fight fenceSafeBlock's own deliberate multi-line-chunk
 * handling (F-f2dc3caf). Instead, `neutralizeInvisibleControls` (imported
 * from commands/lib/escape-reason.js, the SAME disclosed lib→commands
 * import seam findings-render.js's F-c3d8fd7e fix established this package,
 * one file over) neutralizes ONLY the invisible/deception codepoint class
 * (Default_Ignorable incl. the Tag block, bidi controls, C0/C1 non-
 * whitespace, pathological combining-mark runs) — composed with, not
 * replacing, fenceSafe/fenceSafeBlock, which stay scoped to their own
 * backtick-fence job. Backslash, quote, tab, and newline all survive
 * untouched, so ordinary prose and paths stay exactly as legible to the
 * reading agent as before.
 *
 * CROSS-DOMAIN NOTE: `neutralizeInvisibleControls` is exported by
 * commands/lib/escape-reason.js, owned this wave by swarm-cp-verbs (which is
 * hardening that same module in parallel). This file only IMPORTS the
 * export; it does not define or duplicate the primitive. If the export is
 * not yet present when this file's own tests run, the import itself fails
 * loud — see this domain's wave-24 output for the coordination note.

 * Neutralize CommonMark fence markers inside interpolated prose (F-019d40b2),

 *
 * Every prompt built here embeds a worked-example ```json ... ``` fence
 * AFTER interpolating agent- or LLM-authored text (prior findings, finding
 * descriptions/recommendations) that this function does not control. A run
 * of 3+ literal backticks is a CommonMark fence marker; an ODD count of them
 * inside the interpolated text flips the fence-toggle parity for the REST of
 * the document — the real ```json opener meant to start the worked example
 * gets consumed as the CLOSER for the wrongly-opened fence instead, so the
 * worked example renders unfenced and the document ends still "inside" an
 * open fence. Proven against two real findings (F-de02ea22, F-1c99c064) whose
 * own description text was about this exact fence-parity class of bug in
 * scripts/check-doc-drift.mjs.
 *
 * An EVEN count of 3+-backtick runs is NOT a hazard — it already self-closes
 * under CommonMark's fence-toggle model, and it is the overwhelmingly common
 * LEGITIMATE shape: a well-formed fenced code example inside a finding's
 * free-form description/recommendation (one opening fence, one closing
 * fence). F-01458fdb: transforming unconditionally — the pre-fix behavior —
 * mangled that legitimate shape into garbled inline `<code>` spans (proven
 * against a real CommonMark+GFM engine), a NEW cost this function introduced
 * that the pre-fix text never had. Checking parity FIRST means only the
 * actual hazard (an ODD count — a stray, unpaired run) pays the
 * transformation cost; a well-formed paired example is left untouched and
 * renders correctly.
 *
 * When the hazard IS present, the fix still interleaves a zero-width space
 * (U+200B) between every backtick in every run of 3+, so no run of 3+
 * CONSECUTIVE backtick characters survives to be mistaken for a fence marker
 * by any CommonMark-conformant reader — while the visible text (a zero-width
 * space renders as nothing) is unchanged for a human or an LLM reading it.

 * Apply fenceSafe PER FINDING to an already-joined multi-finding blob, rather

 *
 * F-62e467be: fenceSafe's odd/even parity check is trustworthy for ONE
 * contiguous piece of authored prose — a single finding's own description or
 * recommendation, F-01458fdb's contract — because within one author's text a
 * paired (even) backtick-run count really is overwhelmingly likely to be one
 * legitimate opening + closing fence. buildAuditPrompt's only caller
 * (commands/dispatch.js) never hands fenceSafe one finding's text, though: it
 * hands opts.priorContext, ALREADY joined from every prior finding's raw
 * description into one multi-line blob (one bullet line per finding,
 * `- [status] finding_id: description (file)`) before this module ever sees
 * it. Two INDEPENDENT findings can each carry their own odd (hazardous)
 * backtick-run count that happens to SUM to an even total, and a single
 * fenceSafe(wholeBlob) call would then trust the region between them as
 * "closed" — even though a real top-to-bottom CommonMark reader renders
 * every OTHER finding sandwiched between the two stray runs as if it were
 * inside an open code fence. Proven live: two findings with one stray
 * backtick run each (2 runs total, even) left a third, unrelated finding
 * between them rendered inside a fake open fence, while the aggregate parity
 * check saw nothing wrong.
 *
 * This recovers the SAME per-finding unit buildAmendPrompt already uses
 * without this problem — that call site never concatenates findings before
 * calling fenceSafe; each finding's own description/recommendation gets its
 * own separate call (see the findingsList map below). dispatch.js's bullet
 * format is a documented, load-bearing contract (its own comment describes
 * it as "one bullet line per finding"), so a chunk boundary is recovered by
 * splitting on `- [` at the START of a line — the same anchor discipline
 * runner.js#extractTestCount uses to tell a real summary line from indented
 * continuation content. A chunk with its own legitimate, evenly-paired
 * fenced example — which may itself embed newlines, e.g. a multi-line code
 * block inside one finding's description — survives byte-identical, because
 * the chunk boundary keeps that example's own opener+closer pair together in
 * one fenceSafe call, exactly as a lone finding's text always has.
 *
 * Residual (honest, bounded — narrowed by F-f2dc3caf): the boundary is a
 * heuristic anchored on dispatch.js's actual bullet format, not a
 * structural parse — this module has no finding-boundary metadata to parse
 * against once the caller has already joined everything into one string.
 * F-f2dc3caf: the ORIGINAL anchor (`/^- \[/gm`, matching ANY line starting
 * with the two literal characters `- [`) called the over-segmentation risk
 * "vanishingly unlikely," but it was proven reachable by an entirely
 * ordinary shape — a finding's own multi-line description embedding a GFM
 * task-list checklist (`- [ ] step one` / `- [x] step two`) inside an
 * otherwise legitimate, evenly-paired fenced repro-steps example. Every
 * checklist line matched the bare anchor too, over-segmenting ONE finding
 * into three chunks and neutralizing BOTH markers of a well-formed fence
 * that would otherwise have survived (F-01458fdb's own protection).
 *
 * The anchor now requires the FULL real-bullet shape —
 * `- [<2+ word chars>] <colon-terminated token>` — rather than the bare
 * `- [` prefix. CommonMark/GFM task-list syntax is ALWAYS a single
 * space/x/X inside the brackets (never 2+ word characters), so a checklist
 * line can never satisfy the tightened anchor; it is simply never a
 * boundary candidate, and the finding's whole chunk (fence included) is left
 * intact for a single, whole-chunk fenceSafe() parity check — the same
 * treatment any lone finding already receives.
 *
 * A fence-parity-aware scan (walk the text, toggle an "inside a fence" flag
 * on every backtick run, and reject a `- [` candidate found while that flag
 * is set) was considered and rejected: it cannot distinguish a fence that
 * belongs to and re-closes WITHIN the current finding (the checklist case
 * above) from several INDEPENDENT findings whose own individually-odd stray
 * markers merely happen to sum to even ACROSS a finding boundary — exactly
 * the shape F-62e467be's own pin suite (templates-fence-safe-concatenation
 * .test.js) exists to keep splitting correctly. Collapsing that distinction
 * would silently re-merge neighboring findings into a shared fake fence,
 * regressing F-62e467be. Anchoring on the real bullet shape sidesteps the
 * ambiguity: boundaries are still found unconditionally, independent of any
 * fence state, so F-62e467be's per-finding isolation is untouched, and a
 * checklist line is simply never a candidate in the first place.
 *
 * The residual left standing is narrower, not zero: a finding's own
 * description containing a line that happens to match the FULL tightened
 * shape — a 2+-letter bracketed word immediately followed by a
 * colon-terminated token with no space between them, e.g. a quoted example
 * of another finding's own bullet, or a hyphenated-key log-line sample like
 * `- [ERROR] auth-failed: ...` — would still over-segment. That residual is
 * smaller than the one it replaces (it requires mimicking dispatch.js's
 * specific bullet grammar, not just two Markdown characters) and inherits
 * the same strictly conservative failure direction: a legitimate paired
 * fence split across an accidental boundary becomes two odd chunks and BOTH
 * get neutralized (a fenced-code rendering the reader would otherwise have
 * kept is lost), never the reverse (an actual hazard slipping through
 * because a neighbor chunk happened to complete its parity). That asymmetry
 * — safe to over-transform, never safe to under-transform — is the same
 * "bounded, never data loss" shape fingerprint.js's disambiguateFingerprints

### Python: your interpreter probably does NOT see this worktree

A Python repo usually has ONE shared virtualenv with the package installed
editable against the MAIN checkout. If so, \`import ${pkg}\` from inside this
worktree resolves to the main checkout's source — so \`pytest\` here collects
YOUR tests but imports code you did not edit. Your fixes become invisible to
your own test run, in BOTH directions: a correct regression test reads as a
failed fix, and a green suite proves nothing.

Verify before trusting any result:

\`\`\`
python -c "import ${pkg},inspect,os;p=inspect.getsourcefile(${pkg});print(p);print('IN WORKTREE:',os.path.abspath(p).lower().startswith(os.getcwd().lower()))"
\`\`\`
${alsoKnown}
If that prints \`IN WORKTREE: False\`, re-run everything with your own source
first on the path, and re-check the line above before believing the result:

\`\`\`
PYTHONPATH=${srcRoot} python -m pytest -q
\`\`\`

Then re-verify every red-then-green claim you have already made, and say in
your output summary which results were measured under the corrected path. Do
NOT "repair" this with \`pip install\` — reinstalling the editable rewrites
the shared venv that every sibling agent is also using, which is outside
every domain's scope.

## Isolated worktree (provisioned)

The path above is an ISOLATED git worktree, not the main checkout. If this
repo is an npm-workspaces monorepo, its workspace links
(\`node_modules/<name>\` → this worktree's own package dirs) were provisioned
at dispatch, so bare workspace imports resolve to THIS worktree's code.

Before trusting any test run, you may spot-check containment:

\`\`\`
node -e "console.log(require('fs').realpathSync('node_modules/<workspace-pkg-name>'))"
\`\`\`

That path must sit UNDER this worktree. If any workspace package resolves
OUTSIDE the worktree (into the main checkout), STOP trusting test results and
report it in your output summary. Do NOT "repair" resolution with
\`npm install\` / \`npm ci\` — that can rewrite package-lock.json, which is
