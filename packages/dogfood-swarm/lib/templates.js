- Defensive coding gaps (missing guards, unchecked returns)

- Error messages: do they help the user fix the problem?
- Reconnection/retry feedback: does the user know what's happening?
- Responsive layouts: does the UI work at all breakpoints?
- Loading states: is there feedback during async operations?
- State persistence: does the app remember user context across sessions?
- Accessibility of content: keyboard navigation, screen reader support

- Color/theming including dark mode parity, contrast ratios
- Animated demonstrations (GIFs/screenshots for marketplace)
- Command palette presentation (categories, descriptions, icons)
- Status bar integration, first-run welcome, settings UI grouping
- Marketplace listing visuals (hero banner, badges, screenshots)

Frontend domain primary; Bridge + CI/Docs participate. Visual polish is NOT
