/**
 * advance-gates-count.test.js — F-efe53969 (site 2 of 2): lib/advance.js
 * had TWO stale "evaluate ALL five gates" comments (lines 106 and 337-338)
 * left over from before the v9 adjudication gate was added — the `gates`
 * array assembled in checkGates() has SIX entries (wave, agent, ownership,
 * verify, finding_severity, adjudication), not five, confirmed by direct
 * count. Comment/config drift of the same shape this wave's docs audit
 * exists to catch, just inside .js source rather than a doc file.
 *
 * This pins the BEHAVIORAL fact the comments describe (every gate always
 * evaluated, never truncated) so a future stale-comment drift of this exact
 * shape has a red test, not just a corrected comment.
 *
 * The Atlas delta gate (lib/atlas-delta.js) made it seven. The file was named
 * for the count, which is how a name goes stale, so it is named for the
 * property now; the count lives in the assertion, where a new gate reds it.
