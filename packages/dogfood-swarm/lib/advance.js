/**
 * advance.js — Advancement law for the swarm control plane.
 *
 * Formalizes what blocks advance, what requires amend, what permits promotion.
 * Every advancement is recorded as a promotion with gate results and override trail.
 *
 * Phase progression:
 *   health-audit-a  → health-amend-a  → health-audit-a (repeat) OR health-audit-b
 *   health-audit-b  → health-amend-b  → health-audit-b (repeat) OR health-audit-c
 *   health-audit-c  → health-amend-c  → health-audit-c (repeat) OR stage-d-audit
 *   stage-d-audit   → stage-d-amend   → stage-d-audit (repeat)  OR feature-audit
 *   feature-audit   → feature-execute → feature-audit (repeat)  OR test
 *   test            → treatment
 *   treatment       → complete
 *
 * Amend phases advance back to their audit phase:
 *   health-amend-a  → health-audit-a (re-audit)
 *   health-amend-b  → health-audit-b (re-audit)
 *   health-amend-c  → health-audit-c (re-audit)
 *   stage-d-amend   → stage-d-audit  (re-audit)
 *   feature-execute → feature-audit  (re-audit)
 *
 * Gate verdicts:
 *   BLOCK   — hard gate failure, cannot advance
 *   AMEND   — findings need fixing before advancing to next stage
 *   VERIFY  — wave collected but not verified yet
 *   ADVANCE — all gates passed, ready for next phase

 *   - overall 'corroborate' → PASS. The family-different panel agrees the
 *     artifact meets its criteria.
 *   - overall refute / contested / insufficient_context → FAIL, OVERRIDABLE.
 *     The jury flagged a problem (a decided failure, a split panel, or a
 *     coverage gap). It never HARD-blocks — that would make the advisory jury
 *     into law — but it requires Director disposition (`swarm advance --override
