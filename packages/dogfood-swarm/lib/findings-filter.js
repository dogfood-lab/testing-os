/**
 * findings-filter.js — Domain-scoped finding selection for amend prompts.
 *
 * Both `dispatch` (initial amend wave) and `resume` (re-dispatch after timeout
 * or failure) must hand each domain agent ONLY the approved findings whose
 * `file_path` falls inside the agent's owned globs. This shared helper is the
 * single source of truth for that filter.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   The original dispatch path tried to filter via the `file_claims` table
 *   joined to the agent's domain. But audits never write file_claims (only
 *   amend agents do, when they edit), so the join returned 0 rows for every
 *   domain on the FIRST amend wave. The old fallback then loaded ALL approved
 *   findings and fed them to every agent — defeating exclusive ownership and
 *   causing every agent to attempt every fix. The resume path was even worse:
 *   it skipped the filter entirely and always sent everything.
 *
 * Glob semantics match `lib/domains.js#checkOwnership`: `minimatch` with
 * `dot: true`, any-match across the domain's glob list. A finding with no
 * `file_path` falls back to `filed_by_domain` (v10, C3 amendment) instead of
 * being excluded outright — see findingsForDomain's own doc for why.

 *
 * `nocase` is load-bearing, not a convenience (run swarm-1788165870-6880 wave 2,
 * 2026-08-31): callers mix case-folded and raw inputs — declared-closures.js folds
 * the PATH through normalizeFilePathForGlobMatch (lowercase) while domain globs
 * arrive RAW, so a domain owning `README*` / `SHIP_GATE.md` could NEVER close a
 * finding on those files ('readme.pypi.md' vs 'README*' under case-sensitive
 * minimatch); only all-lowercase filenames closed. Same trap class F-00d67cb6
 * fixed from the path side in fingerprint.js, and the open F-f347d858 names at
 * collect.js. normalizePath already treats case-variant spellings as the SAME
 * file for identity, so ownership matching folds case too — in the one shared
 * matcher, so every caller (closure, routing, id-reuse vouching) inherits it
 * rather than each re-fixing one side. lib/domains.js's checkOwnership calls
 * minimatch directly (raw-vs-raw, self-consistent) and is deliberately not

/**

 * that is the correct answer (this domain has no work this wave).
 *
 * F-874c0683 / F-aa32371b (C3 amendment): a finding with no `file_path` at
 * all (a repo-level / file-less finding — proven at pass scale by this
 * wave's own dispatch preview: 40 file-less feature findings routed to ZERO
 * agents) has no glob to match against, so the file_path branch below can
 * never select it for ANY domain. Before this fallback that meant an
 * approved file-less finding was permanently unroutable — see dispatch.js's
 * own F-aa32371b comment, which surfaces exactly this class as a loud
 * dispatch-time warning because nothing could ever fix it. The fallback
 * routes a file-less finding to whichever domain FILED it
 * (`findings.filed_by_domain`, stamped once at upsert from the collect-time
 * `_declaringDomain` attribution — see lib/fingerprint.js#upsertFindings).
 * `filed_by_domain` is NULL for every pre-v10 row and for any finding
 * upserted before a caller threaded `_declaringDomain` through; those rows
 * still fall through to "routes to no domain" here — the honest answer,
 * since there is no recorded filer to route to, not a guess.

 * @param {import('better-sqlite3').Database} db

 * @param {{globs: string[], name?: string}} domain — domain row with globs
 *   already parsed to array. `name` is required for the file-less fallback to
 *   have any effect — a caller that passes a bare `{ globs }` (no `name`)
 *   degrades silently to the pre-fallback behavior for file-less findings
 *   only (never a false match: `filed_by_domain === undefined` is never true
 *   for a real filed_by_domain string). F-762d2b9b: this omission is now
 *   diagnosed loudly (see below) rather than only disclosed in this
 *   docstring — a documented risk nobody reads is the same as an
 *   undocumented one.
 * @param {Array<object>} [allDomains] — every domain row of the run. When
 *   given, a finding with a file_path routes only to that file's exclusive
 *   owner under resolveExclusiveOwner, the arbitration collect enforces.
 *   Without it, overlapping globs (`packages/**` and `packages/**\/*.test.*`)
 *   handed one finding to both domains (commandui run swarm-1791046650-fb76,
 *   wave 6: eleven test-file findings briefed to backend or desktop as well as
 *   tests). A path no exclusive domain owns keeps the membership answer.
