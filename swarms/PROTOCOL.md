# Dogfood Swarm Protocol v2.0

## Overview

The Dogfood Swarm Protocol orchestrates a **model-tiered** fleet of Claude Code agents through a 10-phase play (Stage A Bug + Stage B Proactive + Stage C Humanization + Stage D Visual Polish, then Feature Pass phases 5-8, Final test phase 9, and Full Treatment phase 10) that first establishes a clean bill of health, then builds features to production readiness, and finally polishes for ship. A coordinator reads this document and executes it step by step.

**The phases below describe the *play*. They do not describe the *verification*, and the two are not separable.** Opus executes by default (Sonnet where a task's shape suits it), Fable clerks and takes complex work, a family-different non-Claude jury renders the authoritative non-deterministic evidence, and `swarm verify` is the only thing that is law. Read **[The verification funnel](#the-verification-funnel-read-this-before-dispatching-anything)** immediately below before dispatching a single agent — a run that follows the phases while skipping the funnel produces a correlated single-model fleet whose wave advances on nobody's verdict.

All artifacts live under `swarms/<run-id>/` (relative to repo root), where `<run-id>` is minted by `swarm init` as `swarm-<unix-timestamp>-<4-hex>`. Each wave writes agent prompts to `swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/<domain>.md`, and each agent drops its result at `swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/<domain>/output.json` — the layout `swarm collect --all` auto-discovers. The control plane itself is `swarms/control-plane.db`, and it — not any file on disk — is the source of truth for run state.

## The verification funnel (read this before dispatching anything)

> **This section is load-bearing and post-dates the phase mechanics below.** A run that follows the 10-phase play while ignoring this section will dispatch a single-model agent fleet and advance a wave on nobody's verdict. That has happened. The authoritative spec is [`docs/case-file-contract.md`](../docs/case-file-contract.md); this section is the operator-facing summary, and the contract wins on any conflict.

The swarm's verification layer is a **funnel**, and the seats are not interchangeable:

| Seat | Model | Role | Authority |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Coordinator / Director** | Opus | Orchestrates, authors every public surface, disposes. **Never a juror.** | final disposition |
| **Executor** | **Opus** by default; **Sonnet** where the task's shape suits it (narrow, mechanical, well-specified); **Fable** for complex work | Audit + amend domain agents — the generators | proposes |
| **Scout / mechanical** | **Sonnet** or **Haiku** | Cheap recon, path sweeps, enum sync, count checks | proposes |
| **Clerk** | **Fable** | Assembles the neutral case-file. **Renders NO verdict.** | advisory, verdict-free by construction |
| **Jury** | **non-Claude**, and the two tiers seat **different rosters**: `--jury=local` (5) — `mistral-small:24b` · `granite4.1:30b` · `qwen2.5:7b` · `gemma4:31b` · `hermes3:8b`; `--jury=prism` (3) — `mistral-small:24b` · `qwen2.5:7b` · `hermes3:8b`, the 30B pair excluded because prism's hard 30s ceiling makes them abstain (`--cloud`: the local tier switches to `DEFAULT_JURY_SEATS` — the same five local seats plus `gpt-oss:120b-cloud` and `glm-4.6:cloud`, seven in all, held in comment-pinned lockstep with `LOCAL_JURY_SEATS` and guarded by a parity test — while the prism tier appends `gpt-oss:120b-cloud` only) | The only family-different verification | **strong evidence** |
| **Floor** | `swarm verify` (the real test suite) | Deterministic | **LAW — the only thing that is** |

**Why the jury cannot be a Claude model.** Every Claude model — Opus, Fable, Sonnet, Haiku — is one family, so no Claude model can independently verify another Claude model's work (Panickssery et al. NeurIPS 2024, arXiv:2404.13076: self-preference correlates linearly with self-recognition). `buildJurySpec` enforces this as **Lock 1** and throws if any seat is the producer family. A same-family "review" is a second opinion, not verification.

**Why a single-model agent fleet is a defect, not a convenience.** Knight & Leveson 1986 (DOI 10.1109/TSE.1986.6312924) and its coding-agent replication (Ron/Baudry/Monperrus 2026, arXiv:2606.20158 — **429 coincident failures vs 115 predicted, z=29.20**) both measure the same thing: independently-developed versions fail together far more than independence predicts. Six auditors on one model share a blind spot **by construction**. The seat that answers this is the **jury** — non-Claude, outside the family — not the tier of the generators. Ruled 2026-09-06: the executor seat defaults to Opus, Sonnet is used where a task's shape suits it, and Fable takes complex work and the clerk brief; the earlier Sonnet-executor default is withdrawn. Wave width is the operator's call, one agent per domain with work.

**The wave gate.** `swarm adjudicate <run-id> --case-file <path> [--jury=local|prism] [--cloud]` dispatches the case-file to the family-different jury and records an **advisory** verdict on the current wave. `checkAdjudication` (schema v9, `lib/advance.js`) then gates advance: **corroborate** clears; anything else is an overridable BLOCK requiring Director disposition (`swarm advance --override --reason`). **An ungated advance is a protocol violation.** Even a unanimous corroborate does not advance a wave alone — `normalizeAdjudication` sets `advances_wave_alone: false`, because the deterministic floor must pass too and outranks the jury in gate precedence.

**The clerk prepares; it must not persuade.** Two things flow from the producer side to the jury and they get opposite handling: the producer's **justification** ("it's right *because* Y") is persuasion and is stripped; the **task specification** (objective, falsifiable criteria, grounding evidence) is the rubric and must be provided — withholding it is what *causes* local jurors to hallucinate confident verdicts instead of abstaining. `toJuryRequest()` is **fail-closed**: it runs the neutrality lint and throws `CaseFileNeutralityError` before the jury is ever called.

**The two tiers.** `--jury=local` (default, free) gives diversity **across** seats — one judgment per seat. `--jury=prism` gives L3 (four decorrelated lenses) + L4 (submodularity collapse-refusal) **within** each seat, per criterion, plus a signed Ed25519 receipt per call. Slower, abstains more, by design. prism needs `PRISM_SIGNING_KEY` or it fails closed on an unsigned receipt.

**Read `docs/case-file-contract.md` before your first `swarm adjudicate`.** Its "honest boundary" tables state what each tier does **not** give you — those are load-bearing, not caveats.

## Standards compliance

Scored against the six [workflow standards](../.claude/rules/workflow-standards.md), 0–3. **Total: 12 / 18** for a repository with an Atlas map, **11 / 18** without one. Last scored 2026-07-15 (run `swarm-1784091637-5127`, Stage A); DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS re-scored 2026-09-23 for the Atlas-drafted domain map.

| Standard | Score | Evidence | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| PIN_PER_STEP | **2** | Each wave writes its agent prompts to `swarms/<run-id>/wave-N/<domain>.md` (the byte-exact brief is on disk), captures a `domain_snapshot_id` at dispatch that `collect` validates against, and records output artifacts with a SHA-256. So the *prompt* and the *domain contract* are pinned and enforced. | **The resolved model id is not recorded anywhere**, so a wave is reproducible in brief but not byte-for-byte replayable. P1: persist `model` + prompt SHA-256 per `agent_run`. |
| ANDON_AUTHORITY | **2** | Real and firing: `collect` moves a bad output to `invalid_output` / `ownership_violation` — BLOCKED statuses with no outbound transition that require an explicit coordinator override carrying a reason; the wave flips to `failed` on any validation error; `doctor` exits non-zero on hard FAIL. Trial C of the 2026-04-11 dogfood proved a malformed output is blocked, not silently retried. | **Not a 3, because this run proved four gates certified success in exactly the state they exist to catch** (`redrive` receipt-integrity, `fingerprint` deferred-protection, `check-finding-regression-pins`, `PROVENANCE_ADAPTERS`) — all four have since been fixed with mutation-proof pins (waves 2 and 4), but the class outlives its instances. An andon that cannot fire is not authority. P0: every gate ships a meta-test that mutates the protected thing and asserts RED — see [Proving a gate](#proving-a-gate). |
| NAMED_COMPENSATORS | **2** | The compensators table below is now complete and every swarm-state action has a named, dry-run-by-default, reason-required undo (`rewind` / `redrive` / `revalidate` / `clean`), each writing its own audit row. | **Not a 3: no rollback meta-test exists.** A compensator that has never been proven to restore is prose. P1: a drill that mutates state, runs the compensator, and asserts the pre-state is restored. (`redrive`'s integrity assert, previously listed here as running after its transaction commits, now runs inside the transaction and rolls back on mismatch — F-ad3004f4, wave 2.) |
| DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS | **3** with an Atlas map, **2** without | The frozen domain map is exactly this standard: draft → edit → freeze, exclusive file ownership, glob-specificity arbitration via `resolveExclusiveOwner`, enforced at collect time against the snapshot captured at dispatch. Every change is logged to `domain_events`. **With an Atlas map the decomposition is derived and checked, not asserted:** the domains are unions of the repository's own parts, the draft is proven to cover every tracked file exactly once, and the freeze records a passing `atlas check` and the map commit (see [When the repository has an Atlas map](#when-the-repository-has-an-atlas-map); `packages/dogfood-swarm/atlas-domain-map.test.js` proves it on a fixture, twice: by minimatch over `git ls-files`, and by the Atlas engine reading the derived domains as a boundary file). Without a map it stays a hand draft, so a 2. | **`--isolate` is the CLI default** (F-80afe435). Omitted flag creates per-agent git worktrees so collect can independently attribute edits. `--no-isolate` is the explicit shared-worktree escape (unsound for multi-domain amends: an agent that silently edits out-of-domain *and* omits the file from `files_changed` is not independently caught). Ji et al. 2026 (arXiv:2607.02294) measured **55.8–67.8% of coding-agent runs violating at least one boundary**. See §Ownership attribution in non-isolated parallel amend waves. |
| UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS | **1** | The `[!] OWNERSHIP PROBE DEGRADED [!]` banner is a genuine uncertainty surface: it tells the operator the guarantee weakened and names the remedy. In a repository with an Atlas map, every audit brief carries the map's "What this map cannot see" list, which names the unknowns (unresolved imports, run-time paths, unparsed files) a lane must not read as absences. | **The review gates fire on phase boundary, not uncertainty** — Phase 2 and Phase 6 checkpoint every time regardless of how certain the wave is, which trains the operator to rubber-stamp. No checkpoint uses contrastive framing ("you probably expected X; I did Y because…"). P1: gate the review on disagreement/uncertainty, and frame contrastively (Buçinca et al. 2024, arXiv:2410.04253). |
| EXTERNAL_VERIFIER | **2** | `swarm adjudicate` runs a live cross-family jury with a prism-per-seat tier (L3/L4 per seat), and the citation gate defers to a different model family with the caller's reasoning stripped. The standard is implemented, not just named. | **One live hole, and one closed.** CLOSED: `buildSeatEnv` was a *denylist* over the ambient env; it is now an explicit `AMBIENT_PASSTHROUGH_KEYS` allowlist (Saltzer & Schroeder 1975 — base access decisions on permission, not exclusion), so ambient config can no longer silently weaken what the jury guarantees. OPEN (P0): **severity is assigned by the same agent that authored the finding** — the self-preference configuration Panickssery et al. 2024 (arXiv:2404.13076) predicts inflates. Remedy: a cross-family severity panel (Verga et al. 2024, arXiv:2404.18796) with an anchored rubric (Kim et al. 2024, arXiv:2310.08491); keep pointwise labels — Tripathi et al. 2025 (arXiv:2504.14716) measures pairwise flipping 35% vs pointwise 9%. |

> cited "this repo's measured 16→6 HIGH deflation" as established history, and it circulated for a
> full session as the local evidence for the severity remediation above. **It is unsubstantiated.**
> A wave-3 audit queried the control plane directly: the cited run shows **9 HIGH / 35 MEDIUM /

>

> column first** — which is itself a finding: this protocol cannot currently measure the bias it
> names as a P0.

### Compensators

Every world-touching action this protocol performs, its named undo, the post-rollback state, and the owner. **No skip** — the org rule forbids it for any workflow with irreversible calls, and Phase 10 has several.

**Swarm execution (Phases 1–9).** All reversible; all dry-run by default and reason-required.

| Action | Irreversible? | Compensator | Post-rollback state | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agents edit the working tree | No | **`swarm rewind <save-point-tag> --reason "<text>" --apply`** | Tree restored to the save point; orphaned in-flight rows → `aborted_for_rewind`, preserved as forensic evidence | coordinator |
| Wave dispatched; a subset of agents failed | No | **`swarm redrive <run-id> --reason "<text>" --apply`** | Same `wave_id` resumed; completed receipts survive byte-identical; only the failure tail is re-dispatchable | coordinator |
| `agent_run` blocked (`invalid_output` / `ownership_violation`) | No | **`swarm revalidate <run-id> --domain=… --reason "<text>" --apply`** | Agent → `complete` via the override path, with the reason recorded in `agent_state_events`; refuses if the corrected state still fails the checks | coordinator |
| `--isolate` created per-agent git worktrees | No | **`swarm clean <run-id> --apply`** | Worktrees removed; unchanged ones auto-pruned | coordinator |
| Control-plane rows written | Append-only by design | **none needed** — `*_state_events` is the audit trail; never `UPDATE` around it | History is the record; correct forward via the verbs above | coordinator |
| N paid LLM agents dispatched | **Yes** — spent tokens have no undo | **`none` — bounded, owner-accepted cost** (honest treatment of an unavoidable spend, not a real undo) | Tokens spent | coordinator — bounds via ≤10 agents/wave and the per-wave finding cap |

**Full Treatment (Phase 10).** These leave the machine. Each one needs its named undo *before* it is invoked.

| Action | Irreversible? | Compensator | Post-rollback state | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `npm publish` | **Yes** — unpublish is only permitted within 72h, and the name@version is burned permanently either way | **`npm deprecate <pkg>@<version> "<reason>"`** + publish a corrected patch | Version still resolvable but flagged at install; consumers steered to the patch. **You cannot un-ship it** | coordinator |
| `gh release create` | Mostly | **`gh release delete <tag> --yes`** | Release page gone; the git tag survives unless also deleted | coordinator |
| `git push <tag>` | Mostly | **`git push --delete origin <tag>`** | Tag gone from the remote; anyone who already fetched it keeps it | coordinator |
| `git push` to `main` | Mostly | **`git revert <sha> && git push`** — never force-push a shared branch | Change reverted forward; history preserved | coordinator |
| GitHub Pages deploy | No | **Re-run `pages.yml` from the prior commit** | Previous site restored | coordinator |
| `gh repo edit` (description/homepage/topics) | No | **Re-apply the prior values** (capture them first) | Metadata restored | coordinator |
| repo-knowledge DB write | No | **Re-run `scan`** | DB regenerated from source | coordinator |
| A consumer submission committed to `main` by `ingest.yml` | Mostly | **`git revert <sha>` + `rebuild-indexes`** | Record removed and indexes rebuilt; the commit stays in history | coordinator |

### Proving a gate

A gate is not verified because its suite is green. **"Passes N/N" ≠ "seals."** A gate is verified when a **meta-test mutates the thing it protects and asserts the gate goes RED** — delete the documented code and the drift check must fire; force a second module instance and the counter must tick 1→2; empty the watch-set and the integrity check must report `not_applicable`, never a vacuous `true`.

Include **deletion and emptiness** operators explicitly, not just value perturbation. Just et al. 2014 (DOI 10.1145/2635868.2635929) measured that mutant detection tracks real-fault detection more strongly than coverage does — **but that 17% of real faults couple to no mutant at all, "mostly involving algorithmic changes or code deletion."** Every vacuous gate this protocol has shipped was deletion-shaped: an empty watch-set, an empty agent list, a pattern matching nothing. Value-perturbing mutation is blind to exactly that class.

Keep it cheap. Petrovic et al. 2022 (DOI 10.1109/TSE.2021.3107634) report Google made mutation testing viable at scale by surfacing **one mutant per covered line in code review and reporting no mutation score** — no overhead complaints from thousands of developers. Mutate one gate per diff; do not build a mutation matrix.

### Fixing a class, not an instance

**An amend is not done when the named instance is green. It is done when you have swept for siblings and found none.** This is the single most expensive lesson this protocol has: run `swarm-1784091637-5127` spent waves 16→21 rediscovering it, and every wave's confirming audit caught the previous wave's fixes patching the one instance in front of them. The audit is not a formality that finds churn — **it is the mechanism that catches instance-patches masquerading as class-fixes**, and it worked every single time.

This repo already encoded this lesson **for documentation** — doc-drift Class #11, "multi-occurrence fix completeness … per-instance fixes are anti-pattern" (see the comment above `## The 10-Phase Play`). It was never generalized to code. Generalize it:

**Before writing any fix, grep for the defect's shape across the whole tree. Put the sweep's result in your output — including "swept, found none."** A sweep that finds nothing is evidence; a sweep you didn't run is a finding waiting to be filed against you. Measured on the run above: a coordinator sweep for one bad identifier found it in **four** files where the audit had named one; a sweep for a stale claim found it inside the gate's own console output, echoed on every run for two waves after the "fix."

Five sub-laws, each earned by a real defect on that run:

1. **The authoritative source, never memory.** Finding ids come from the control-plane DB (the brief is generated from it) — never from an audit's `output.json`, whose ids are agent-local labels. Scope comes from the frozen domain map — never from a coordinator's prose. Coverage comes from the gate's own output — never from recollection. Three consecutive waves shipped auditor-local ids into briefs, and one reached four code artifacts as an id that does not exist.
2. **A detector's blind spot IS the defect.** When a sweep misses an instance, the instance is the symptom; fix the sweep. A sweep searching for `spawnSync` missed `execFileSync` twice — and when it was made call-shape-agnostic it immediately surfaced a further instance using **the very name the original searched for**, proving the gap was never the spelling but that no sweep had enumerated the population. **Enumerate the population independently and diff it against what your detector sees.**
3. **Prose is not code.** Any gate that greps raw source will eventually credit a comment (false grant) or trip on one (false positive). Both happened here: the pin matcher leaked on seven consecutive audits crediting prose, and a wave-2 pin false-positived when a comment mentioned the very call it forbids. **Strip comments before asserting** — `packages/dogfood-swarm/test-support/strip-comments.js` exists for this.
4. **"Passes against real data" can be true and useless.** A verification that cannot fail is not a verification. One wave claimed "zero false rejections against the real corpus" — true, and worthless: the corpus contained zero records of the shape under test. The next wave's matrix varied every axis except the one its own warning was about. **Exercise the shape, not the corpus** — and state which axes you varied.
5. **A fix is not done until its consumer is wired, and a count is not integrity.** A helper exported and unit-tested but imported by zero production code does not close its finding (the finding's own stated goal went unmet for two waves). A frozen manifest guarded by `length === 256` is guarded by a headcount: swap a drained id for a fresh one and the count holds. **Content-address what must not change** (RFC 8785 + SHA-256 — as the grandfather-manifest gate now does via `EXPECTED_GRANDFATHER_MANIFEST_HASH`, and as `packages/ingest/lib/integrity.js` does for the record hash-chain), and check the consumer, not just the artifact.

## Prerequisites

- Target repo exists under `mcp-tool-shop-org` or `dogfood-lab` (or `mcp-tool-shop` for marketing repos)
- Local clone of the target repo on disk; `origin` points to the correct remote
- Git working tree clean on the target repo (no uncommitted changes)
- Save point tag created before first wave for easy revert

---

<!-- drift-checked by scripts/check-doc-drift.mjs — see Class #11 (multi-occurrence fix completeness). Update all Stage D / 10-Phase mentions together; per-instance fixes are anti-pattern. -->

## The 10-Phase Play

The protocol has two repeating passes plus a final test phase and full treatment:

- **Health Pass** (Phases 1-4) — Audit and fix bugs, security, code quality, type safety, test coverage, doc accuracy across **four pre-feature stages** (A bug/security, B proactive health, C humanization, D visual polish). Repeat until clean bill of health.
- **Feature Pass** (Phases 5-8) — Audit and build missing capabilities, feature gaps, UX improvements. Repeat until production-ready.
- **Final** (Phase 9) — Comprehensive test validation.
- **Full Treatment** (Phase 10) — Shipcheck, branding, landing page, handbook, translations, repo-knowledge DB. The repo is not "done" until it's whole.

---

## Health Pass (Phases 1-4) — Four stages to clean bill of health

The Health Pass has four distinct stages, each applying a different lens. Stages A and D each run a full Audit → Review → Amend → Repeat cycle (Phases 1-4) within the stage itself. Stages B and C instead split one such cycle across the stage boundary — B audits and reviews, C amends what B found — rather than each independently repeating the whole cycle:

- **Stage A: Bug/Security Fix** — Find and fix defects. Repeat until 0 CRITICAL + 0 HIGH.
- **Stage B: Proactive Health** — Fresh audit with proactive lens (defensive coding, observability, graceful degradation, future-proofing). Review findings.
- **Stage C: Humanization** — Amend the proactive findings with emphasis on USER EXPERIENCE: error messages that help, reconnection feedback, responsive layouts, loading states, state persistence, accessibility. This is the bridge between "not broken" and "actually good to use."
- **Stage D: Visual Polish** — Final pre-feature pass focused on the visual surface: typography/spacing/layout, iconography & assets, color/theming/dark-mode, animated demonstrations, command palette presentation, status bar integration, first-run welcome, settings UI grouping, marketplace/landing-page visuals.

**Key insight:** Proactive health, humanization, and visual polish findings are NOT afterthoughts — they represent the gap between "code that works" and "code that respects the user." The Stage C and Stage D amend waves treat these findings with the same rigor as bug fixes because polish IS quality.

---

### Phase 1: HEALTH AUDIT

Launch 5 parallel agents, one per domain, to audit all components.

1. Create a save point tag before the first wave:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-root>
   git tag swarm-save-$(date +%s)
   ```

2. Launch 5 agents with these domain assignments:

   | Domain | Scope | Typical Files |
   |--------|-------|---------------|
   | Backend | Core server logic | server.py, main modules |
   | Bridge | Secondary services | ws_bridge.py, API bridges |
   | Tests | Test suite | tests/*.py, conftest.py |
   | CI/Docs | Infrastructure + docs | .github/workflows/, *.md, config |
   | Frontend | UI layer | *.html, *.css, *.js |

   For larger repos, expand up to 10 agents by splitting domains.

   When the repository has adopted Atlas (`atlas/boundaries.yaml`), `swarm init` drafts the domains from its parts instead of this table, and the freeze runs `atlas check`. See [When the repository has an Atlas map](#when-the-repository-has-an-atlas-map). A repository without a boundary file uses this table exactly as before.

3. Each agent audits its domain. When the repository has an Atlas map, each lane's brief also carries its **blast radius**, derived, not written: the "What breaks what" rows for the parts its domain holds (who imports each part in production, who only from tests, which doors pass through it), `atlas explain <file> --json` for each entry point in its domain (five at most, the rest named), and the page's "What this map cannot see" list with the instruction to read an absence as unknown. `swarm dispatch` builds it once per wave, keeps each lane's section on the wave so `swarm resume` briefs a redispatched lane with the same text, and leaves it out, never fails, when the map cannot be read or `atlas explain` cannot run. The section is context, not scope; the domain contract still bounds what a lane reads. A repository without a boundary file gets briefs without it.

   The audit lens depends on the current stage:

   **Stage A (Bug/Security Fix):**
   - Bugs and logic errors
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Code quality issues
   - Type safety violations
   - Test coverage gaps
   - Documentation accuracy

   **Stage B (Proactive Health):**
   - Defensive coding gaps (missing guards, unchecked returns)
   - Observability (logging, metrics, health checks)
   - Graceful degradation (offline behavior, partial failure handling)
   - Future-proofing (extensibility, migration paths)

   **Stage C (Humanization):**
   - Error messages: do they help the user fix the problem?
   - Reconnection/retry feedback: does the user know what's happening?
   - Responsive layouts: does the UI work at all breakpoints?
   - Loading states: is there feedback during async operations?
   - State persistence: does the app remember user context across sessions?
   - Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, contrast

   **Stage D (Visual Polish):**
   - Typography, spacing, and layout consistency across surfaces
   - Iconography and asset quality (logos, screenshots, social cards, favicons)
   - Color, theming, and dark-mode parity
   - Animated demonstrations / GIFs / motion
   - Command palette and status bar presentation (for editor-integrated tools)
   - First-run welcome and onboarding visuals
   - Settings UI grouping and labeling
   - Marketplace listing visuals and landing-page polish

4. Agent output format:
   ```json
   {
     "domain": "backend",
     "stage": "A|B|C|D",
     "findings": [
       {
         "id": "F-001",
         "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
         "category": "bug|security|quality|types|tests|docs|defensive|observability|degradation|future-proofing|ux|accessibility|hygiene|error_message_quality|cli_help_quality|silent_failure|tests_coverage",
         "file": "path/to/file.py",
         "line": 42,
         "description": "What is wrong",
         "recommendation": "How to fix it"
       }
     ],
     "summary": "Brief domain health assessment"
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: REVIEW

Coordinator presents consolidated findings to the user.

1. Merge all agent outputs into a single findings list.
2. Sort by severity: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW.
3. Present to user with counts per severity level.
4. User approves, modifies, or rejects findings before any code is written.
5. Record the approvals in the control plane: `swarm approve <run-id> --ids F-…` (or `--all`).

### Phase 3: AMEND

Launch 5 parallel agents with exclusive file ownership to fix all approved findings.

1. Map approved findings back to domain agents. Each agent only edits files within its domain.
2. HARD RULE: No agent edits a file outside its assignment. Validate with:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-root>
   git diff --name-only | sort > /tmp/changed-files.txt
   ```
   Cross-reference every changed file against domain assignments.

3. After all agents complete, verify build passes:
   ```bash
   # Node/TypeScript
   npm run lint && tsc --noEmit && npm test

   # Rust
   cargo check && cargo test

   # Python
   ruff check . && pytest
   ```

4. If build fails, dispatch targeted fix agents for the failing domain only.

### Phase 4: REPEAT

Return to Phase 1 for a fresh audit against the remediated codebase.

- Each cycle is a clean audit — agents do not carry forward prior findings.
- **Checkpoint with user every 3 iterations** to confirm direction.
- **Stage A:** Continue until audit returns 0 CRITICAL + 0 HIGH. Then `swarm advance` to Stage B (`health-audit-b`).
- **Stage B:** Run one proactive audit cycle. Review findings. **`swarm advance` is not how Stage C starts.** Live advancement law (`lib/advance.js`) only routes `health-audit-b` → `health-amend-b` when open CRITICAL/HIGH remain; otherwise it promotes to `health-audit-c` and **skips** the humanization amend. Stage B findings are usually MED/LOW. That skip is a verb fact, not a waiver of Stage C.
- **Stage C:** Amend the proactive findings through the humanization lens. After approve, dispatch it: `swarm dispatch <run-id> health-amend-b --isolate --skip-verify`. Do not type `swarm advance` and expect `health-amend-b`. When that amend is complete, proceed to Stage D.
- **Stage D:** Run one visual-polish audit cycle, then a visual-amend wave. When complete = **clean bill of health**. Proceed to Feature Pass.

---

## Feature Pass (Phases 5-8) — Repeat until production-ready

### Phase 5: FEATURE-FOCUSED AUDIT

Agents audit for capabilities, not defects.

1. Launch 5 agents (same domain split; in a repository with an Atlas map each brief carries the lane's blast radius, as in Phase 1) to evaluate:
   - Missing capabilities and feature gaps
   - Production readiness (error handling, logging, graceful degradation)
   - UX improvements (CLI ergonomics, API surface, user-facing messages)
   - Performance opportunities
   - Integration completeness

2. Agent output format:
   ```json
   {
     "domain": "backend",
     "features": [
       {
         "id": "F-001",
         "priority": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
         "category": "missing-feature|ux|performance|integration|production-readiness",
         "description": "What is needed",
         "scope": ["file1.py", "file2.py"],
         "effort": "small|medium|large",
         "recommendation": "How to implement"
       }
     ],
     "summary": "Domain feature assessment"
   }
   ```

### Phase 6: REVIEW

Coordinator presents feature findings to user BEFORE any code is written.

1. Merge all feature findings, sorted by priority.
2. Present to user with effort estimates.
3. User approves which features to build in this wave.
4. **No code is written until user approves the feature list.**

### Phase 7: EXECUTION

Agents build/improve approved features with exclusive file ownership.

1. Map approved features to domain agents.
2. HARD RULE: No agent edits a file outside its assignment.
3. Launch up to 5 agents in parallel.
4. After all agents complete, verify build passes (lint + typecheck + tests).
5. If new tests are needed for new features, the Tests domain agent writes them.

### Phase 8: REPEAT

Return to Phase 5 for a fresh feature audit.

- **Checkpoint with user every 3 iterations.**
- Continue until the codebase is production-ready (no CRITICAL or HIGH feature gaps remain).

---

## Final (Phase 9)

### Phase 9: TEST

`test` is a **run status**, not a dispatchable phase. It is not in `AUDIT_PHASES` / `AMEND_PHASES`. `swarm dispatch <run-id> test` is `DISPATCH_INVALID_PHASE`. `swarm advance` after a verified confirming `feature-audit` is the only lawful promotion (`PHASE_MAP`: `feature-audit` → `test`).

The CLI's "Next: swarm dispatch … test" after that promotion is a **lie**. Ignore it. File it later; do not obey it.

Coordinator Phase 9 (no agent wave):

```bash
swarm advance <run-id>
npm run verify
swarm doctor
```

On this repo, `npm run verify` is the comprehensive pass (sync-version, doc-drift, Class #14 pins, build, script tests, workspace tests). Unpiped. Keep the log. `swarm doctor` is part of the pass (stranded-worktrees WARN is not a delete; reclaim with `swarm clean`).

Do **not** advance again. Next promotion is `treatment` → `complete`. Leave the run sitting on `test` until Phase 10 is called. Do not `complete`. `--check-only` showing BLOCK (wave status: advanced) is the waypoint, not a next dispatch.

If verify fails, file and fix as coordinator or a targeted amend — do not invent a `test` wave.

---

## Full Treatment (Phase 10)

The swarm is not complete until the repo receives the Full Treatment. This phase ensures the repo is not just working but *whole* — branded, documented, searchable, and catalogued.

### Prerequisites

- Phase 9 tests must be green.
- Read `memory/full-treatment.md` AND `memory/handbook-playbook.md` from the canonical memory path before starting.
- Shipcheck must pass: `npx @mcptoolshop/shipcheck audit` — if it fails, fix before proceeding.

### Execution

Follow the 7 phases from `full-treatment.md` in order:

1. **Phase 0 — Shipcheck gate**: `npx @mcptoolshop/shipcheck init` + audit. Version bump (v0.x → v1.0.0, or patch bump).
2. **Phase 1 — README + translations**: Logo, badges, footer. Hand user the translation command (user runs locally, NEVER Claude).
3. **Phase 2 — Landing page**: `npx @mcptoolshop/site-theme init`, scaffold site-config, verify base path.
4. **Phase 3 — Handbook**: `npx @mcptoolshop/site-theme handbook --accent <color>`, expand README into 3-7 real doc pages, build + verify.
5. **Phase 4 — Repo metadata + coverage**: GitHub description/homepage/topics, coverage badge if applicable.
6. **Phase 5 — Repo Knowledge DB**: `node dist/cli.js scan`, add thesis/architecture/relationships.
7. **Phase 6 — Commit + deploy**: Stage explicitly (never `git add .`), push, verify landing page + handbook render.

### Completion

After Phase 7 (post-deploy verification) passes:
- Advance the run to `complete`: `swarm advance <run-id>` from the treatment phase records the final promotion.
- Record final metrics: test count, findings fixed, features shipped, treatment phases completed (`swarm verify` receipt + `swarm status`).

### Do NOT

- Skip any treatment phase — they are sequential and interdependent.
- Run translations from Claude — user runs locally via Ollama (zero cost).
- Skip the repo-knowledge DB entry — it's part of the swarm now.
- Mark the swarm complete before the landing page + handbook are live.

## Serial final verification after parallel agents

When parallel agents each run `npm test` / `npm run verify` against a worktree containing other agents' WIP edits, the verify reads against cumulative state. Sibling agents see "failures" that are not contract violations but measurement artifacts: an integration test fails because backend hasn't yet landed its half of a coordinated fix; `check-regression-pins` fails because the source pin landed and the sibling pin hasn't yet. This is a Class #14 fractal at the verifier layer — the verifier is in the thing being verified.

The serial-final-verify discipline closes the gap:

1. **Coordinator dispatches with `--skip-verify`** when running an amend wave with parallel agents: `swarm dispatch <run-id> health-amend-a --skip-verify` (see `packages/dogfood-swarm/commands/dispatch.js` SKIP_VERIFY_DIRECTIVE).
2. **Agents make edits, write their output JSON, and stop.** No per-agent `npm test`. Agents emit `verification_skipped: true` at the top level of their output JSON to make the contract explicit (`packages/schemas/src/json/agent-output.schema.json` `verification_skipped`).
3. **`swarm collect` propagates the flag.** When any agent marks `verification_skipped: true`, the collect report sets `serial_verify_required: true` and the CLI surfaces a Next-step hint (`packages/dogfood-swarm/commands/collect.js` `serial_verify_required`).
4. **Coordinator runs ONE `npm run verify` against the cumulative tree** before promoting the wave. This is the only authoritative verification for the wave.

Skip the directive when dispatching a single-agent wave or when agents are not running in parallel — the per-agent verify is then a legitimate independent check, not a vantage-point artifact.

## Cost bounds for parallel amend waves (earned armature, 2026-09-06)

Three waves in one day on a 7,500-test repo — seven parallel Opus agents, two full suite legs per agent, a
pre-edit floor run per agent, per-agent pin re-derivation, multi-thousand-word relay posts, and a Fable
clerk rebuilding the case-file each wave — consumed the account's weekly token budget: ≈ 1.8M subagent
tokens for a seven-domain audit, ≈ 2.9M for a six-domain amend, ≈ 0.3–0.6M per clerk, and the
coordinator's own context on top. The serial-final-verify section above already forbade per-agent
verification; the coordinator's briefs overrode it. These bounds are the harness's own law and the
dispatch directive carries them into every parallel amend prompt (`SKIP_VERIFY_DIRECTIVE`,
`packages/dogfood-swarm/commands/dispatch.js`):

1. **An agent never runs the full suite** — no pre-edit floor, no post-fix full leg, no `-O` leg. It runs
   the test modules its fixes touch, once. The coordinator's serial verify on the merged tree is the one
   authoritative run; `verify.ps1` / `npm run verify` is the coordinator's second leg.
2. **Pins are measured once, at the merge, by the coordinator** with each module's own derivation. Agents
   update only a literal inside a module they own and say so.
3. **Relay posts are bounded** — one before the first edit only when a shared surface is at stake, one at
   commit, each under 300 words, facts only.
4. **The clerk brief is Fable's seat** (ruled 2026-09-06), fed by the run's build script: the case-file's fix
   entries, raise sites, criteria and out-of-scope list are mechanical, so the script assembles them and the
   clerk seat reads facts instead of re-deriving the tree.
5. **The shape is the bound.** Under 1–4 a wave costs a fraction of the old one by construction; nothing is written or read before a dispatch beyond the brief.

*Withdrawn the same day it was written (2026-09-06): a rule capping a wave at three agents. Wave width is the
operator's call — one agent per domain with work — and the harness's own defaults never changed; the cap was an
inference from the token arithmetic, not part of what was asked.*

## CI-minute bounds for what a wave WRITES (earned armature, 2026-09-07)

The bounds above meter **tokens**. They say nothing about **Actions minutes**. Measured 2026-09-07 from the
org billing API: armature was burning **441 CI min/day — 1,324 of the org's 3,010 Actions minutes for the
month, 44%** — out of a `ci.yml` the swarm itself wrote. Free only because the repo is public; the same
shape on a private repo consumes a Free org's entire 2,000-minute monthly allowance in under five days.

**The mechanism: the coordinator's rig-local verification ritual gets transcribed into `ci.yml`.**
`verify.ps1` runs the suite twice — plain, then `-O` with `PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1` — which is correct on the rig,
where it is one authoritative serial run per wave on free hardware. armature's `ci.yml` carries both legs
across a 2-version matrix, so the once-per-wave ritual became **four full suite runs per push**. Run
`34106483511`: 22.2 + 22.2 min on 3.11, 18.4 + 19.4 on 3.13 — **82 of 84 minutes, 97.6%, is one pytest
suite executed four times.**

Bound 1 above forbids an agent an `-O` leg. It governs the agent's shell. These govern what the wave commits,
because a shape written into `ci.yml` outlives every wave that produced it.

6. **A full-suite re-run is a rig ritual, not a CI shape.** A second full-suite leg in `ci.yml` (`-O`, a flag
   sweep, a re-run under a different env) runs **the subset that asserts the property, on one matrix cell.**
   armature's `-O` obligation is 94 lines across **19 of 196** test files: the leg re-runs all 4,497 tests to
   check what 9.7% of them assert, on both interpreters — when assert-stripping is interpreter-wide behaviour
   a second Python version cannot disprove. Narrowing takes the run from ~84 min to ~43.
7. **Every workflow a wave writes states its per-push minute cost in a comment**, measured from real job
   timings (`gh api repos/<r>/actions/runs/<id>/jobs`), never estimated. These files are otherwise densely
   commented; the cost is the one fact that went unwritten, which is why it grew unchallenged.
8. **`push` + `pull_request` on the same paths double-fires**, and `group: <workflow>-<github.ref>` cannot
   collapse it — push sees `refs/heads/<branch>`, the PR sees `refs/pull/N/merge`. Verified on armature runs
   `34111791960` (push) and `34111797073` (pull_request): same `head_sha` `783e1219`, four seconds apart,
   both running the full 84-minute matrix. Use `group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.ref }}`.
9. **A wave that leaves Dependabot enabled owns the doubled bill** from 8. Studio rule is no `dependabot.yml`
   unless requested; if a repo keeps it, set `interval: monthly`, `open-pull-requests-limit: 3`, and `groups`.

**The check, once per wave, before the push:** `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<id>/jobs` on the
wave's own CI run, with per-job minutes recorded in the FACTS receipt beside the test counts. A wave already
records what it proved; this records what proving it cost.

## Ownership attribution in non-isolated parallel amend waves

`swarm collect` enforces exclusive file ownership (Key Principle #1) against the **union** of two sets: the agent's self-reported `files_changed`, and an **independently-computed** touched-file set probed straight from git via `lib/git-touched-files.js` — `git status --porcelain` (uncommitted + untracked) **plus a committed-delta diff against the dispatch base** (the worktree's fork point under `--isolate`, `runs.commit_sha` otherwise; F-4ba6036b — without the committed half, an agent that `git commit`ed inside its worktree vanished from the probe entirely). The independent probe is the part that catches an agent which under-reports `files_changed` — it is the external check on a self-reported field (a Class #14 "verifier in the thing being verified" surface).

That independent check has a **hard prerequisite: per-agent isolation.** When a wave runs WITHOUT `--isolate`, every agent shares one worktree (`run.local_path`), so the git probe returns the cumulative whole-tree diff of *all* agents' edits. git cannot attribute a given file to a given agent. Attributing that union to each agent would flag every *other* domain's legitimate edits as ownership violations and fail a clean wave on phantom cross-domain edits (the bug fixed in `d3b-collect-A-002`). To avoid that, in a non-isolated wave `collect` narrows each agent's independent contribution to the files that agent **exclusively owns** — resolved by the same glob-specificity arbitration `checkOwnership` enforces with (`resolveExclusiveOwner`), NOT by bare glob membership. (`wave2-live-001`: membership-narrowing over-collects when globs overlap — a `**/*.test.*` domain was phantom-flagged for sibling package domains' test-file edits, because membership admitted files whose *exclusive* owner was the package domain.)

The narrowing is correct for the phantom-violation problem, but it carries a **deliberate, documented soundness reduction**:

> **In a non-isolated amend wave, ownership enforcement is sound only for an agent's SELF-REPORTED edits.** An agent that silently edits a file **outside** its domain **and** omits that file from its `files_changed` is no longer caught by the independent probe — the out-of-domain file is filtered out of the independent set because another domain exclusively owns it. The self-reported `files_changed` is still checked in full, so a self-confessed out-of-domain edit is still caught; only the *silent + unreported* case slips through.

**`--isolate` is the CLI default** (F-80afe435). Each agent gets its own git worktree (`dispatch.js` → `lib/worktree.js`), so the worktree diff holds only that agent's edits, the full diff is attributable, and the independent under-report catch is preserved across domains. `--no-isolate` is the explicit shared-worktree escape — use it only for a single-domain wave or when you will hand-review every agent's diff yourself. Bare `swarm dispatch <run> <phase>` isolates.

How the weakened guarantee is surfaced (so it is never silent):

- **Per agent:** the agent's collect record carries an `ownership_probe_degraded` note (`{ isolated: false, reason: … }`) pointing the operator at `--isolate` (`packages/dogfood-swarm/commands/collect.js`).
- **Per wave:** when two or more domains were degraded in one shared worktree, the collect report sets `ownership_probe_degraded.multi_domain = true` and the CLI prints an `[!] OWNERSHIP PROBE DEGRADED [!]` banner recommending `--isolate`. This is observability only — like the `files_changed` divergence note, it never changes the exit code or the wave gate.

The gate itself is unchanged: a real, self-reported out-of-domain edit still flips the agent to `ownership_violation` and the wave to `failed` in either mode. `--isolate` widens *what the independent probe can prove*, not what the gate does once a violation is known.

## Recovery from blocked agent_runs: `swarm revalidate`

Sometimes an amend wave's `swarm collect` rejects every agent's output for a schema or ownership reason that is real but **recoverable**: the agent did the work, the work is correct on disk, the JSON envelope drifted from the canonical shape (`fixes_applied` vs `fixes`; `files_edited` vs `files_changed`), or the coordinator-frozen domain map omitted a glob the brief told the agent to edit. In those cases the four `agent_runs` move to a blocked status, the wave moves to `failed`, and nothing in the audit lane offers a path back. The lawful recovery verb for that exact shape is `swarm revalidate`.

### The two blocked statuses

`packages/dogfood-swarm/lib/state-machine.js` defines a 9-status state machine for `agent_runs` (pending, dispatched, running, complete, failed, timed_out, invalid_output, ownership_violation, aborted_for_rewind — matching the handbook's "The 9 canonical statuses"). Two of those statuses form the BLOCKED_STATUSES set declared in the same module — `invalid_output` and `ownership_violation`. Neither has any outbound transition in the normal `TRANSITIONS` map; the state-machine deliberately requires explicit coordinator override to move them.

- **`invalid_output`** — the agent's JSON failed the canonical `agent-output.schema.json` envelope, the legacy `validateAuditOutput` / `validateFeatureOutput` / `validateAmendOutput`, or one of the legacy normalization passes downstream. The output is on disk; the gate refused it.
- **`ownership_violation`** — the agent's `files_changed` set contains paths that lie outside the agent's frozen domain map. The work landed in the worktree; ownership accounting refused to claim it.

These are repairable but never auto-retryable: the source of failure was not transient, and any retry without operator review would either repeat the violation or paper over a real drift.

### The override primitive (library level)

The canonical override has lived in `packages/dogfood-swarm/lib/state-machine.js` since the BLOCKED_STATUSES set was introduced:

```text
transitionAgent(
  db,
  agentRunId,
  'complete',
  reason,
  /* override */ true
)
```

Override requires a non-empty `reason` (`state-machine.js` line 106: `throw new Error('Override requires a reason …')`). The transition writes a row to `agent_state_events` capturing `from_status`, `to_status`, the reason, and the timestamp — the same audit trail every normal transition produces, but explicitly flagged as an override. Until `v1.1.7-…`, this primitive had no operator-facing CLI surface; recovery required raw SQL.

### The CLI verb

`swarm revalidate` exposes the override lawfully:

```text
Usage: swarm revalidate <run-id>
  --reason "<text>"
  --domain=name:path
  [--domain=name:path ...]
  [--apply]
```

Behavior (from `packages/dogfood-swarm/commands/revalidate.js`):

1. **Dry-run by default.** No `--apply` ⇒ revalidate inspects each corrected output JSON against the same envelope schema + legacy validator + ownership check that `collect` would have run, builds a `report.repairs[]` list of "would transition", and returns without touching the DB. The repair preview lets the operator see what would change before any state leaves disk.
2. **`--apply` is required to mutate.** With `--apply` and at least one repair planned, revalidate opens a single SQLite transaction and per repair: calls `transitionAgent(db, ar.id, 'complete', reason, true)`, records the output artifact with its SHA-256, mirrors the `file_claims` rows `collect` would have written for amend outputs.
3. **`--reason "<text>"` is mandatory.** The library rejects empty/whitespace reasons before any DB connection is opened. The reason is recorded verbatim in `agent_state_events` for every override transition in the wave.
4. **Refusals are first-class.** If the corrected JSON still fails the envelope, the legacy validator, or the ownership check, revalidate refuses the repair and records the refusal in `report.refusals[]` — the agent_run stays in its blocked status, and the operator sees a structured reason rather than a silent ignore. Already-complete rows are skipped idempotently.
5. **Wave-level rollback in the same transaction.** `collect.js:373-377` sets `waves.status='failed'` when `validation_errors > 0`. Revalidate mirrors the inverse direction: after every per-repair override, if every latest `agent_run` in the wave is now `complete` AND the wave was `failed`, the same transaction also runs `UPDATE waves SET status='collected', completed_at=datetime('now') WHERE id = ?`. Same transaction prevents the torn-state regression (agents complete, wave still `failed`) if the process crashes mid-flight. Partial repair (N=4 blocked, repair N-1) keeps the wave in `failed` deliberately — only full repair flips the wave back.

### When to use it (and when not)

Use `swarm revalidate` when:

- `swarm collect` reports `validation_errors > 0` and the wave is `failed`.
- The output JSON on disk is correct (or has been hand-corrected) and reflects work the agent actually did.
- The reason is documentable in one sentence (it becomes part of the run's audit history).

Do NOT use `swarm revalidate` to bypass a real ownership violation. If an agent genuinely edited files outside its domain, the lawful response is to roll back the work, fix the domain map (or the brief), and re-dispatch — not to override the gate. Revalidate refuses repairs that still fail ownership checks for exactly this reason: the override path only opens when the corrected state passes the same checks `collect` would have applied.

### Architectural grounding

The shape — "executed but produced invalid output is repairable in place, with a required reason captured in audit history" — appears across the workflow-orchestration field: AWS Step Functions Redrive, Temporal workflow reset, Airflow `clear` / `set-state`, Argo retry, GitHub Actions `rerun --failed`. Direct DB intervention is universally last-resort; toolchains mediate state mutation through tooled commands that emit an event-sourced audit row alongside the UPDATE (Stripe Ledger correction-event pattern). `swarm revalidate` is the testing-os instance of that family.

## Key Principles

0. **Public surfaces are coordinator-authored (LAW)** — README + translations, docs/handbook, landing page, CHANGELOG, repo metadata, package descriptions, and any marketing copy are authored PERSONALLY by the coordinator. Never assign a public-surface file to a subagent or spawn a docs/readme/landing-page/marketing agent. The docs domain may be a frozen domain (so no other agent touches it) but the coordinator executes it by hand. In-code user-facing strings (CLI `--help`, error messages) a feature agent drafts get a personal coordinator review-and-rewrite pass. Earned 2026-06-20 (backpropagate v1.7).
1. **Exclusive File Ownership** — No agent edits a file outside its assignment. Violations trigger revert. The *independent* (non-self-reported) ownership check is sound across domains only under `--isolate`; in a non-isolated parallel amend wave it covers each agent's self-reported edits plus its own domain's files — see §Ownership attribution in non-isolated parallel amend waves.
2. **Wave Size** — Max 5 agents per wave (one per domain). Expand to max 10 for large repos by splitting domains.
3. **Severity Triage** — All findings are triaged CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. Remediation follows severity order.
4. **Build After Every Wave** — Build must pass after every amend/execution wave (lint + typecheck + tests).
5. **Save Point** — Tag before first wave for easy revert.
6. **Four-Stage Pre-Feature** — Stage A fixes bugs/security, Stage B applies proactive hardening, Stage C humanizes behavior/text, Stage D polishes visuals. All four complete before features.
7. **Health Before Features** — Feature execution only begins after clean bill of health.
8. **User Reviews First** — User reviews feature audit BEFORE execution begins. No code without approval.
9. **Control-Plane Checkpoint** — the SQLite control plane (`swarms/control-plane.db`) is the single source of swarm state for resumability. See §Run state — there is no `manifest.json`.
10. **Evidence Persisted** — Evidence persisted to repo-knowledge DB after each wave.

## Domain Agent Assignments

| Domain | Scope | Typical Files |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Backend | Core server logic | server.py, main modules, core packages |
| Bridge | Secondary services, APIs | ws_bridge.py, API bridges, middleware |
| Tests | Test suite, fixtures | tests/*.py, conftest.py, test helpers |
| CI/Docs | Infrastructure + documentation | .github/workflows/, *.md, config files |
| Frontend | UI layer | *.html, *.css, *.js, templates |

Adjust domains to match the repo's architecture. The key constraint is that every file belongs to exactly one domain, and no two agents share files.

### When the repository has an Atlas map

A repository that has adopted Atlas already states its architecture: `atlas/boundaries.yaml` names its parts and the globs that own them, and `atlas check` in its CI proves no file is in two parts and no new file is in none. The domain map starts from those parts instead of the table above. **Atlas is never a prerequisite:** a repository without a boundary file is drafted from the table exactly as before, `swarm init --no-atlas` keeps the table on a mapped repository, and a map that cannot be used (absent `atlas/structure.json`, a file new since the map) degrades the draft to the table with a printed note rather than failing `init`.

The draft rule, as `swarm init` and `swarm domains <run-id> --from-atlas` apply it:

1. **The parts are read from the committed map**, `atlas/structure.json`: the boundary file's parts as `atlas map` wrote them (`atlas check` fails if the two differ), with the per-file roster and the part-level import edges. The swarm reads the files; it does not import Atlas.
2. **A test part joins the part it tests.** A part whose role is `test` joins the part it imports most, unless `--tests-domain` asks for one tests domain, which then holds test parts only.
3. **Parts merge until there are five domains** (`--domains <n>` up to ten, Key Principle #2). The smallest goes first and joins the domain that imports it most: production importers, then importers only from tests, then the domain it imports, then one with the same role, then the smallest. A domain is named after its largest part, and its description lists its parts.
4. **Every domain's globs are the union of its parts' globs**, so exclusivity is inherited from the boundary file, not argued again. A file the committed map lists as unassigned joins the domain owning the most files in its nearest directory, as a literal path, and the draft names it. `atlas/` itself becomes the `coordinator` domain `atlas-map`: the page is regenerated with `atlas map` by the coordinator after the serial verify, never edited by a lane.
5. **The draft is checked against `git ls-files`**, not against the map: every tracked file is in exactly one domain, or the draft refuses and names the files. A file that is new since the map needs a part first: add it to the boundary file, run `atlas map`, commit `atlas/`.
6. **The freeze is the receipt.** `swarm domains <run-id> --freeze` (and `dispatch --auto-freeze`) re-runs the coverage check, since a hand edit after the draft can break it, then runs `atlas check` with the pinned `@dogfood-lab/atlas@1.15.0`, fetched by npx into its cache and run from there, so a repository whose own workspace holds Atlas still gets the pinned version. A failed check refuses the freeze. A passing one records, in every domain's `frozen` event and in the run's `atlas_map:<run-id>` record, the map commit the draft came from, the HEAD it was checked at, and whether the draft was edited by hand before the freeze.

The coordinator still reviews the draft before freezing it, as with the table: the rule decides where a part goes, not whether the result suits the run. `--edit`, `--add` and `--remove` work on an Atlas draft as on any other, and the freeze says when they were used.

---

## Run state — the control plane, not a manifest

**There is no `manifest.json`.** Run state lives in the SQLite control plane at `swarms/control-plane.db`, created by `swarm init` and mutated only through the CLI verbs. The DB is canonical; every JSON artifact on disk (wave receipts, collect reports, adjudication receipts) is a derived export of it.

This supersedes the hand-maintained manifest the protocol described before the control plane existed; Key Principle #9 (Control-Plane Checkpoint) states the same rule. The vestigial `swarms/manifest-schema.json` — the schema for the artifact this section retires — carries a deprecation `$comment` and is kept only because paths under `swarms/` are published API.

Read state with `swarm status <run-id>` — it renders the run, the frozen domain map, the current wave, per-agent status, finding counts by severity, and the next action. Add `--format=json` for the structured object. `swarm runs` lists every run; `swarm history <wave-id>` renders a wave's transition chain, including any override-and-reason record.

## Resuming an Interrupted Swarm

```bash
swarm status <run-id>              # READ-ONLY: phase/wave, which agents completed
                                   # vs. missing, and which are [STALE] past the
                                   # timeout policy. Start here.
swarm resume <run-id> --dry-run    # READ-ONLY: what a real resume WOULD time out
                                   # and redispatch. Writes nothing.
swarm resume <run-id>              # MUTATES: redispatch the incomplete agents
```

`swarm resume` is state-machine-driven: it reads `agent_runs` from the control plane, applies the run's timeout policy to transition stale agents deterministically, and redispatches only what is genuinely incomplete. Agents already `complete` are never re-run.

**The wave moves with the agents.** If resume redispatches at least one agent on a wave that is not already `dispatched` — most often a `failed` wave, the state a missing or rejected output leaves behind — it returns the wave to `dispatched` too, in the same transaction, audited in `wave_state_events` with a `resume:` reason. This is the same contract the Three R's carry, read from the other end: a partial write must not leave agents in flight while the wave stays `failed`. It is what makes resume's own closing line ("run the redispatched agent(s), then `swarm collect`") true, since `swarm collect` requires a `dispatched` wave. Redispatching nothing moves nothing — a wave resume did not put back into flight is not resume's to un-fail.

### ⚠ `swarm resume` is NOT a liveness probe

"Are these agents still alive?" and "redispatch the dead ones" are different
questions, and the bare verb only knows how to answer the second. Applying the
timeout policy **transitions** overdue agents to `timed_out`, which is the first
domino of a redispatch — so an operator who runs `swarm resume` in order to
*look* gets a redispatch as a side effect. This has happened in a live run: a
liveness check on `swarm-1785831762-2a42` printed
`Action: redispatched — Redispatched 9 agents` when nothing was meant to re-run.

Use the read-only surfaces instead:

| Question | Verb | Writes? |
|---|---|---|
| Which agents are overdue right now? | `swarm status <run-id>` — overdue rows render `[STALE — past timeout policy]`, and the summary carries `stalePastTimeout` | no |
| What exactly would a resume DO right now? | `swarm resume <run-id> --dry-run` (alias `--preview`) — reports `wouldTimeOut` / `wouldRedispatch` | no |
| Redispatch the dead agents. | `swarm resume <run-id>` | **yes** — new `agent_runs`, new state events, prompts, and any `--isolate` worktrees **recreated from HEAD** |

Both read-only paths and the mutating pass share **one** timeout predicate
(`classifyTimeouts` in `lib/state-machine.js`; `applyTimeoutPolicy` is a thin
mutating wrapper over it), so a preview cannot disagree with the outcome it is
predicting. That property is pinned by `liveness-probe.test.js`, which asserts
the predicted set equals the set actually reaped.

Reserve `swarm resume` for when you have already decided to redispatch.

Three distinct recovery verbs exist, and picking the wrong one wastes a wave — see [Recovery verbs](#recovery-verbs) below for when each applies.

---

## Recovery verbs

**Rewind erases. Redrive resumes. Revalidate ratifies.** They are siblings, not synonyms.

| Verb | Use it when | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `swarm revalidate <run-id>` | An agent did the work correctly but its output JSON was rejected by the schema or ownership gate, and the JSON on disk is now correct | Repairs blocked `agent_runs` in place (BLOCKED → `complete`); flips the wave back to `collected` only when every latest agent_run is `complete` |
| `swarm rewind <save-point-tag>` | The slice itself was a wrong turn and you want the working tree back at the save point | Restores the tree to the tag and lawfully aborts orphaned in-flight rows (status → `aborted_for_rewind`, preserved as forensic evidence) |
| `swarm redrive <run-id>` | The slice was right but a subset of agents failed mid-flight | Resumes the same `wave_id`; completed receipts survive byte-identical, only eligible failed/unstarted agents become re-dispatchable |

`swarm resume` is not a fourth R — it is the ordinary in-wave verb — but it overlaps `redrive` on one state, so pick deliberately: **redrive re-opens, resume re-issues.** Both return a failed wave and its failure tail to `dispatched`. Redrive takes a `wave_id`, moves the existing `agent_runs` in place, and preserves every `complete` receipt byte-identical. Resume takes a `run_id`, applies the timeout policy first, and creates *fresh* `agent_runs` with rebuilt prompts and re-created `--isolate` worktrees. Want the same agents re-run against the briefs they already had — redrive. Want new briefs and clean worktrees for the ones that never reported — resume.

All three share four contracts: **dry-run by default** (`--apply` required to mutate), **`--reason "<text>"` is mandatory** (recorded verbatim in the audit row, prefixed by verb name so the trail is greppable by intent), **zero raw SQL** (all mutations go through `transitionAgent` / `transitionWave` so no write skips its audit row), and **single transaction** (a partial write cannot leave agents `complete` while the wave stays `failed`).

Do NOT use `revalidate` to bypass a real ownership violation. If an agent genuinely edited outside its domain, roll back, fix the domain map or the brief, and re-dispatch. Revalidate refuses repairs that still fail the checks `collect` would have applied — the override path opens only when the corrected state passes those same checks.

The full contract, including the state machine and the `--force-arbitrary-ref` edge, lives in the handbook: [Recovery — The Three R's](../site/src/content/docs/handbook/recovery.md).

### The rest of the verb surface

`swarm --help` is authoritative. The verbs this protocol leans on most: `init`, `domains` (show/edit/freeze/unfreeze/history), `dispatch`, `collect`, `approve`, `defer`, `reject`, `findings`, `status`, `receipt`, `verify`, `adjudicate`, `persist`, `clean`, `doctor`, `runs`, `trends`, `history`.

Two are worth calling out because they are easy to miss:

- **`swarm doctor`** — read-only preflight. Run it before `init` on a new rig: it checks Node ≥ 22, that the control-plane dir is writable **and hardlink-capable** (the file-lock CAS needs `link(2)`; exFAT/FAT32 fail), that the on-disk schema is not newer than the build, and that git is available for the ownership probe and `--isolate` worktrees.
- **`swarm defer` / `swarm reject`** — dispose of a finding without a fix. `defer` = consciously accepted/postponed; `reject` = triaged away as not-a-defect. Both close the finding for the gate, both require `--ids` and `--reason`, and neither has an `--all`. Use them instead of leaving a finding open to keep failing the exit gate.

## Proven Results

| Repo | Waves | Start Tests | End Tests | Findings Fixed | Evidence |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| testing-os v1.9.0 | Stage A–D health pass + feature pass | ~2,106 | ~2,700+ | ~162 pinned | run `swarm-1783007856-9fdb` in `swarms/control-plane.db` (`swarm status`, `swarm receipt`) |
| claude-collaborate | Stage A (2) + B (1) + C (1) | 35 | 71 | 106 | pre-control-plane; hand-recorded, not reconstructible |
| stillpoint | Stage A (3) + B (1) + C (2) + Feature (3) | 26 | 136 | 70 health + ~50 features | pre-control-plane; hand-recorded, not reconstructible |

The two 2026-03 rows predate the control plane, so their numbers cannot be re-derived from any artifact — they are reported here as history, not as evidence. The `testing-os` row is the first that a reader can independently check: the run is in the control plane, and `swarm status <run-id>` / `swarm receipt <run-id>` will render it. Prefer control-plane-backed rows when adding to this table; a number nobody can recompute is a claim, not a proof.
