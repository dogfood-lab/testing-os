/**
 * Structural regression pins for .github/workflows/ci.yml — token scope
 * (F-W1-CI-002), the Node version test matrix (F-W1-CI-010), and the
 * windows-latest win32 proof-of-life job (F-92a05b18).
 *
 * F-W1-CI-002 — ci.yml runs untrusted PR code via `npm ci` + `npm test`, so
 * the GITHUB_TOKEN scope is part of the attack surface. The workflow
 * declares `permissions: contents: read` explicitly at the workflow level
 * rather than inheriting whatever repo-default scope is configured —
 * `contents: read` is the floor `actions/checkout` needs, nothing more (no
 * job in this workflow writes back to the repo). A future edit widening this
 * (or dropping it back to an unstated, potentially-broader repo default)
 * would silently expand what a compromised transitive dependency executing
 * during `npm ci`/`npm test` could do with the token.
 *
 * F-W1-CI-010 — the Node test matrix is `[22, 24]`: Node 20 hit EOL on
 * 2026-04-30 and was dropped; 22 is current Maintenance LTS, 24 is Active
 * LTS. Bumping the matrix surfaces Node 24 native-test-runner / permission-
 * model / fetch behavior drift before downstream consumers hit it. A
 * regression back to including 20 would test an unsupported runtime;
 * `fail-fast: false` stays so both legs always complete and a version-
 * specific failure is distinguishable from a real bug (rather than Node 24
 * cancelling mid-flight when Node 22 fails first).
 *
 * F-92a05b18 — scripts/check-step-fixtures.test.mjs's win32-only resolveSh()
 * branch (Git-for-Windows bundled sh.exe discovery) had zero CI proof-of-life:
 * build-and-test above is ubuntu-latest only, and on Linux the branch is
 * never reached (the preceding plain spawnSync('sh', ...) probe always
 * succeeds first). windows-step-fixtures-proof-of-life is a SEPARATE job,
 * gated `if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'` so it costs nothing on
 * push/PR (github-actions.md: avoid a standing windows-latest leg — roughly
 * 2x the per-minute cost of ubuntu-latest), running ONLY
 * scripts/check-step-fixtures.test.mjs, not the full suite. A regression
 * either removing the job, widening it to push/PR, or broadening it past the
 * one named test file would defeat the narrow, deliberately-bounded cost
 * tradeoff this finding's recommendation asked for.
 *
 * Why text/structure assertions and not a YAML parse: same rationale as the
 * sibling stageA-check-ci-honesty-paths.test.mjs / stageC-check-release-
 * resilience.test.mjs — parsing YAML in a regression test pulls in a
 * dependency just for one fixture. (self-dogfood-workflow.test.mjs uses a
 * real js-yaml parse instead, for a file with indentation-sensitive inline
 * steps where a text scan cannot tell well-formed from broken; ci.yml has no
 * such step, so the lighter text-token convention applies here too.)
