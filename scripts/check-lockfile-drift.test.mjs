/**
 * Regression test for the lockfile-drift gate (H10 / Wave A1 Stage A amend).
 *
 * Why this exists, beyond what sync-version.test.mjs already covers:
 *   sync-version.mjs is a field-stamper. It checks two surfaces — top-level
 *   `lock.version` and `lock.packages[""].version` — and rewrites them on
 *   drift. It does NOT inspect:
 *     - `lock.packages["packages/<name>"].version` (the 7 workspace-package
 *       entries that npm writes into the lockfile alongside their own
 *       package.json fields). At HEAD d0f7a58, these all carried `1.2.2`
 *       while root was at `1.2.3` — invisible to sync-version.
 *     - `lock.packages[""].engines.node`. At HEAD, the lockfile carried
 *       `>=20` while root package.json declared `>=22` (the 2026-05-14
 *       Node 20 EOL bump). Also invisible to sync-version.
 *
 *   The advisor's recommended path is:
 *     (1) heal the lockfile by running `npm install` so every field in the
 *         lockfile is regenerated from the actual workspace state;
 *     (2) add a CI guard (`npm install --package-lock-only &&
 *         git diff --exit-code package-lock.json`) that catches ANY future
 *         drift class, not just the two field-stamper looks at;
 *     (3) add THIS regression test that asserts the two specific surfaces
 *         the field-stamper still misses, wired into `npm run test:scripts`
 *         so local `npm run verify` also fails fast.
 *
 * Strategy: parse the actual repo lockfile + root package.json. Assert each
 * workspace-package entry's version matches root, and that engines.node
 * matches root. The test must FAIL at the pre-fix anchor
 * (`swarm-stage-a-amend1-pre`) and PASS after `npm install` heals it.
 *
 * To anchor the regression: a second test invocation reads
 * `git show swarm-stage-a-amend1-pre:package-lock.json` (or, in CI, a
 * baked-in fixture from .gitattributes is not available — we just run the
 * positive-case assertion against the live tree). The pre-fix anchor case
 * is documented in the wave deliverable rather than shipped as a fixture
 * because it would re-introduce the bad state every time the wave-amend
 * test fixture is updated.
