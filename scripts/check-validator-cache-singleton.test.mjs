/**
 * D2B-015 — Single canonical-validator cache invariant.
 *
 * H3 closes the C1 two-Ajv gap by migrating all four sibling schema
 * compile sites (synthesis/validate-artifacts.js, findings/validate.js,
 * verify/validators/schema.js, ingest/validate-record.js) to delegate
 * to `@dogfood-lab/schemas`'s `validatePayload` / `compileSchema`. The
 * canonical seam holds a module-scope `validatorCache` Map keyed by
 * SchemaName, so within a single Node process the SAME compiled
 * `ValidateFunction` is returned for the same schema name on every
 * call.
 *
 * But: npm workspace hoist resolution can split that cache. If
 * `@dogfood-lab/schemas` is symlinked into multiple packages'
 * `node_modules/` with different resolution paths, each package can
 * end up importing a SEPARATE module instance of `validate.js` — and
 * each instance carries its own `validatorCache` Map. The schema
 * names match, but the compiled validators are distinct references.
 * That is the C1 gap RELOCATED to the cache layer, not sealed: two
 * Ajv instances compiling the same schema, just hidden inside the
 * schemas package instead of inside the consumers.
 *
 * This test pins the structural invariant the migration claims:
 * single canonical compiled validator per schema per process,
 * shared across every consumer. The contract has two halves:
 *
 *   1. STATIC: no `new Ajv` outside `packages/schemas/`. This is the
 *      visible-source half — if any consumer regresses and adds its
 *      own Ajv instance back, this half trips immediately. (The
 *      agent-output schema validator in dogfood-swarm/lib/validate-
 *      agent-output.js compiles a local Ajv: the agent-output schema now
 *      ships via @dogfood-lab/schemas/json/ but is NOT one of the eight
 *      payload schemas wired through the canonical compileSchema/
 *      validatePayload seam — it is a swarm output envelope resolved as a
 *      raw JSON file. Allowlisted explicitly here; see that file's comment.)
 *
 *   2. DYNAMIC: import `compileSchema` from `@dogfood-lab/schemas`
 *      from this script's resolution path; trigger each consumer's
 *      validator (which internally calls `compileSchema` via
 *      `validatePayload`); then call `compileSchema` again from
 *      here. Assert the consumer-side trigger and the direct call
 *      return the SAME `ValidateFunction` reference. If the cache
 *      split, the two references differ and the test trips.
 *
 * Lifecycle: this is the test the audit (Stage A C1 finding) named
 * as the "structural seal" — without it, C1 isn't closed, only
 * relocated.

// Replaces an earlier "before === after compileSchema reference" check

//
//   1. _resetValidatorCacheForTests() clears M_test.cache (M_test = the
//      schemas instance THIS test imported).
//   2. before = compileSchema('record') → populates M_test.cache → V_test.
//   3. validateRecord(bad) runs ingest's code → calls compileSchema on
//      INGEST's schemas instance. If hoist split (M_ingest ≠ M_test),
//      this populates M_ingest.cache and leaves M_test.cache untouched.
//   4. after = compileSchema('record') → M_test.cache hit → returns
//      V_test (the same reference, because M_test was never touched).
//   5. assert.strictEqual(after, before) → V_test === V_test → always

// is shared across module instances, so a counter rooted there is

// evaluates, it increments the counter. A workspace-hoist split that
// loads the module twice → counter goes from 1 to 2. The test asserts
// exactly 1, AFTER every consumer has been imported.
//
// Crucially: the assertion is read from globalThis, NOT from any
// specific module instance's local state. A split module's increment
// IS visible to this test, because both modules write to the same
// global Symbol slot.
//
// The non-vacuity proof (Part 4 below) demonstrates the detector trips
// on a forced second load — confirming GREEN here genuinely means
// one instance, not "test couldn't see the failure."
