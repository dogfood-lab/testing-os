/**
 * Regression test for the ci.yml trigger-path coverage of honesty surfaces
 * (d6-infra-001).
 *
 * Why this file exists: ci.yml's push AND pull_request `paths:` filters gate the
 * doc-drift / sync-version / schema-conformance gates. Before this fix those
 * filters listed packages/**, package*.json, tsconfig*.json, .github/**, docs/,
 * site/, swarms/PROTOCOL.md, and scripts/ — but NOT the repo-root honesty
 * surfaces the gates exist to protect (README.md, SHIP_GATE.md, SCORECARD.md,
 * CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md) nor the schema-conformance fixture tree
 * (swarms/__schema-fixtures__/**). So a commit editing ONLY a root honesty
 * surface or ONLY a fixture triggered no CI run at all — the gate built to stop
 * honesty-surface drift was bypassed at the trigger level for the exact files
 * it guards (a Class-#11-shaped vacuity one layer up from the handler logic).
 *
 * Why text-token assertions and not a YAML parse: same rationale as
 * check-lockfile-drift-ci.test.mjs — parsing YAML in a regression test pulls a
 * dependency in just for one fixture. We extract the two `paths:` blocks by
 * structure and assert each required entry is present in BOTH. This goes RED if
 * any future edit drops a surface from either trigger leg.
