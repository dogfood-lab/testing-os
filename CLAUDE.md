# CLAUDE.md — testing-os repo etiquette

> **Mission frame.** This repo is the testing operating system for an AI-augmented studio. Everything written here — code, commit messages, docs, tests — is also training data for the model that will write the next generation of testing tools. **There is no sense in training on bad data.** Quality over quickness. Clean over clever.

## What this repo is

`testing-os` is the flagship monorepo of the [Dogfood Lab](https://github.com/dogfood-lab) GitHub org — successor to the now-archived `mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs`. It bundles the protocols, schemas, and operating system for testing AI-assisted software at scale.

Eight workspace packages, all `@dogfood-lab/*`:

| Package | Purpose | Source style |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `schemas` | 8 JSON schemas (record/finding/pattern/recommendation/doctrine/policy/scenario/submission) | TypeScript |
| `verify` | Central submission validator | JS |
| `findings` | Finding contract + derive/review/synthesis/advise pipelines | JS |
| `ingest` | Pipeline glue: dispatch → verify → persist → indexes | JS |
| `report` | Submission builder | JS |
| `portfolio` | Cross-repo portfolio generator | JS |
| `dogfood-swarm` | 10-phase parallel-agent protocol + SQLite control plane + `swarm` bin | JS |
| `atlas` | Repository mapper: reads doors, parts, imports, landing places and history, writes the page (`atlas/README.md` + `page.json`) and checks the map in CI; no sibling dependencies, published as a standalone binary | JS |

JS packages use `node --test`. The TS schemas package uses `vitest`. Root `npm test` fans out via `npm test --workspaces --if-present`.

## Hard rules — these have been violated and they cost real time

### 1. Quality over quickness — always
Every line you write may end up in a training set. Sloppy code teaches sloppy code. Half-finished features teach half-finished features. **Don't add a stub and move on.** Either finish the slice or don't start it. If you're under time pressure, ship less, not worse.

### 2. Never narrate what the code does — explain why when non-obvious
Bad: `// loop over the items`. Good: `// retry from index 0 because earlier items may have been mutated by the previous batch`. Most code needs no comment at all — well-named identifiers do the job. Comments rot; code self-documents.

### 3. Don't write to `dist/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `node_modules/`, or `swarms/control-plane.db`
All ignored. If a tool produces them, that's fine — they're regenerated. Never commit them.

### 4. Cross-package imports go through the workspace, not relative paths
- ✅ `import { verify } from '@dogfood-lab/verify'`
- ✅ `import { stubProvenance } from '@dogfood-lab/verify/validators/provenance.js'`
- ❌ `import { verify } from '../verify/index.js'`

The `exports` field in each `package.json` controls what's reachable. Add a subpath export when a sibling package needs an internal file.

#### Workspace dependency graph

The current `@dogfood-lab/*` graph contains a deliberate cycle:

```
findings → ingest → dogfood-swarm → findings
```

- `@dogfood-lab/findings` depends on `@dogfood-lab/ingest`.
- `@dogfood-lab/ingest` depends on `@dogfood-lab/dogfood-swarm` (introduced in v1.1.5 when `ingest/run.js` adopted `dogfood-swarm/lib/log-stage.js` for cross-package staged logging).
- `@dogfood-lab/dogfood-swarm` depends on `@dogfood-lab/findings` (introduced in v1.1.4 when `dogfood-swarm/commands/*.js` adopted `findings/lib/atomic-write.js` for the `unsafeSegment` CAS edge).

**This cycle is accepted by design.** npm workspaces resolve workspace cycles via symlinks at install time — there is no runtime resolution problem because every edge points at a concrete subpath export (`atomic-write.js`, `log-stage.js`) rather than the package root. The `logStage` and `atomicWrite` helpers are cross-package shared discipline; the value is high enough to accept the cycle rather than copy-paste-fork the helpers.

Two design implications:

- Tests in any one of the three packages transitively load the other two siblings via the workspace. That is the expected behavior and the reason `setupTestRoot()` in `packages/ingest/ingest.test.js` copies fixtures into a temp dir rather than relying on the writable shape of any sibling's source tree.
- New cross-package edges should extract a single-purpose leaf helper (like `atomic-write.js` and `log-stage.js` did) rather than widen the cycle into general package-root imports. Each leaf helper should be small enough that a future "split this out into `@dogfood-lab/shared`" refactor is a mechanical move.

The v1.1.4 CHANGELOG framed the `dogfood-swarm → findings` edge as "one-way edge, no cycle." That was true at v1.1.4; v1.1.5 closed the cycle by adding the `ingest → dogfood-swarm` edge for `logStage` adoption. **This subsection supersedes that framing.** The cycle exists by design as of v1.1.5; do not try to "fix" it without first deciding whether the leaf helpers should be extracted into a shared package.

### 5. Schema JSON files live in `packages/schemas/src/json/` — read via `createRequire`
```js
import { createRequire } from 'node:module';
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
const schemaPath = require.resolve('@dogfood-lab/schemas/json/dogfood-finding.schema.json');
const schema = JSON.parse(readFileSync(schemaPath, 'utf-8'));
```

Never duplicate schemas at the repo root. There is one source of truth: the `schemas` package.

### 6. Tests run against real fixtures, not mocks
Mocked validators that pass while production fails are worthless. The runtime data dirs (`policies/`, `fixtures/`, `records/`, `indexes/`) exist precisely so tests exercise the real code paths.

### 7. Don't roll the build forward when packages are still empty
[scripts/build.mjs](scripts/build.mjs) is wave-tolerant: it skips `tsc --build` when `packages/` has no real package, and runs it for real once one exists. Keep that pattern when adding new TS packages — the gate is "does `packages/<name>/package.json` exist".

### 8. Ignore the `claude-preview` hook
This repo is a Node monorepo (CLIs + a SQLite-backed control plane), **not** a web app. The hook will demand `preview_start` after every edit — ignore it. Verification here is `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm pack`, never a browser.

### 9. Match scrutiny to blast radius
Single-file or single-repo changes can land directly on main when the diff is right. Bulk cross-repo changes — migration cutovers, mass refactors, fleet dependency bumps — deserve a review pass: branch, audit your own diff, then merge. The cutover precedent (Wave 6 of the migration: bulk direct push to 8 shared repos was correctly blocked) was the right block at the right scope; everyday single-repo work is not the same animal. Don't manufacture a PR for a one-line fix; don't skip one for an 8-repo sweep.

### 10. Match existing patterns before inventing
This repo mirrors `world-forge` deliberately (npm workspaces, `tsc --build` composite refs, lockstep versioning, single path-driven CI). When in doubt, look at how `world-forge` does it. Don't add Turbo, changesets, or a different test runner without explicit need.

## Conventions

### npm scope and naming
- Scope: `@dogfood-lab/*` (singular, no `s` — that suffix is the legacy `@dogfood-labs/*` which is retired)
- Package names mirror the directory: `packages/findings/` → `@dogfood-lab/findings`. Exception: `dogfood-swarm` (the directory name disambiguates from generic "swarm")

### Versioning
**Lockstep.** All packages bump together. Currently **`1.12.0`** ([release v1.12.0 cut 2026-09-06 — the armature run's harness fixes: `adjudicate --wave`, `SWARM_VERIFY_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS`, cost bounds rendered into every parallel amend prompt, the jury runner sending its measured `num_ctx`, nocase closure globs, the roadmap recurrence scope; the executor seat re-ruled to Opus by default with Sonnet where the task suits it and Fable for complex work and the clerk brief; SECURITY contact moved to GitHub advisories and four operator-identity strings scrubbed]; [release v1.11.0 cut 2026-08-26 — dogfood-swarm 3 on run `swarm-1787700871-d537`: `coordinator` ownership class, `--isolate` as the dispatch default, `swarm doctor` environment checks, Phase 9 as a run status not a dispatchable phase, Set-1/Stage C/D health fixes; ledger 33 fixed / 4 deferred / 11 unverified / 0 CRIT / 0 HIGH; run stays at `test`]; [release v1.10.0 cut 2026-07-17 — the trajectory layer (compiled roadmap artifact + advisory attention list + bounded operator notes) and the evidence-bearing closure verbs (`swarm reopen`/`close`), then the wave-40→44 confirming-audit arc that made the pass's own closure machinery actually close it: file-less routing/vouching/fingerprint-fusion + honor-reuse fixes, the Amendment 3 roadmap-artifact vocabulary reconciliation (first artifact to validate against the full schema), the T4 seeding flags built end to end, and the explicit-seed / UTC / phases-consolidation fixes. Ledger at release: 473 fixed, 18 deferred, 16 rejected, zero open; run swarm-1784091637-5127 stays OPEN (a waypoint, not closure)]; [release v1.9.0 cut 2026-07-03 — the full-dogfood-swarm release: four-stage health pass (~162 pinned fixes, run swarm-1783007856-9fdb) + approved feature pass — `swarm defer`/`reject` verbs, `dogfood-verify lint --scenario`, required-steps enforcement wired end-to-end (404 → accepted-with-warning), self-dogfood workflow + badge, read-model handbook page, revalidate full-coverage reclassification; operational faults (PROVENANCE_FAULT / VALIDATOR_FAULT_* / scenario-fetch-fault) now throw instead of persisting `_rejected`; findings package test discovery un-orphaned 16 files; suite ~2,106 → ~2,700+ tests]; [release v1.8.0 cut 2026-06-30 — VERIFY-F3: author-time `policy-lint` verb (`dogfood-verify lint <policy-file>`) — the `opa check` analogue: structural gate + data-independent predicate checks (`unknown_field`/`max_depth`/`node_budget`) over every `when` with no submission, plus the advisory `[]`-footgun warning (negation-parity suppression, cross-family-jury-improved) + honest static-coverage boundary; wired into `npm run verify` via `scripts/lint-policies.test.mjs` (no 5th workflow)]; [release v1.7.0 cut 2026-06-30 — VERIFY-F1: declarative no-eval policy-predicate engine (field/op/value + all/any/not/implies authored in YAML), `attested-if-human` migrated as the byte-identical differential-equivalence proof, DoS budgets + structural non-weakening + the `policy-config:` diagnostic class; cross-family-jury-hardened (DoS + `[]` fail-open + origin-misclassification)]; [release v1.6.0 cut 2026-06-29 — dogfood swarm: health pass A–D (41 findings) + honesty/capability feature pass: forbidden_tags policy gate made real, served shields.io badges + trends, `swarm clean` verb, `dogfood-report --status` consumer confirm, accepted-with-warning channel, `--json`/`--dry-run`/`--grep` ergonomics]; [release v1.5.0 cut 2026-06-21 — dogfood swarm: health hardening + record integrity (hash chain + opt-in XRPL anchor) + GitLab provenance + consumer onboarding]; [release v1.4.0 cut 2026-06-13 — health pass + 4-wave feature pass]; [release v1.3.1 cut 2026-06-01](https://github.com/dogfood-lab/testing-os/releases/tag/v1.3.1); release v1.3.0 cut 2026-06-01; release v1.2.3 cut 2026-05-20; first stable v1.0.0 cut 2026-04-25). Seven of eight `@dogfood-lab/*` packages publish on a release tag (every package not marked `private`); `portfolio` remains workspace-internal. `atlas` joins the published set at the first tag after 2026-09-22. The README's `<!-- version:start -->` block is auto-stamped by `scripts/sync-version.mjs` (runs as `prebuild`). Use `npm run sync-version:check` as a CI gate when you bump.

### TypeScript
`tsconfig.base.json` is the only place to set compiler options. Per-package `tsconfig.json` extends it and adds `outDir`/`rootDir`/`include`. `composite: true` everywhere. Never set `baseUrl` (deprecated; bit repo-knowledge in CI).

### CI + workflows
Six workflows, each with a distinct purpose — exceeds the org-wide soft cap of 2 from `.claude/rules/github-actions.md`, but each is genuinely needed and bundling would be worse:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `ci.yml` | `push` / `pull_request` on `packages/**`, `package*.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `.github/workflows/**`, `docs/**`, `site/**`, `swarms/PROTOCOL.md`, `swarms/manifest-schema.json`, `swarms/templates/**`, `scripts/**`, `policies/**`, `fixtures/**`, `dogfood/**`, and the root honesty surfaces (`README.md`, `SHIP_GATE.md`, `SCORECARD.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`) + `swarms/__schema-fixtures__/**` + `atlas/**` | Build + test on Node 22 + 24, then `atlas check` against the committed map |
| `ingest.yml` | `repository_dispatch` (`dogfood_submission`) + `workflow_dispatch` | Receives consumer dogfood submissions, runs `packages/ingest/run.js --provenance=github`, commits new records + indexes back to `main`. Concurrency-serialized at workflow level; push conflicts handled by git pull --rebase retry loop (3 attempts). |
| `pages.yml` | `push` to `main` on `site/**` or `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | Builds the Astro Starlight handbook, deploys to `dogfood-lab.github.io/testing-os/`, curls the URL with retry to verify deploy. |
| `release.yml` | `push` of a `v*.*.*` tag + `workflow_dispatch` (tag input) | Publishes every `@dogfood-lab/*` package not marked `private` (seven, including `atlas`) to npm via OIDC trusted publishing (`--provenance`) and creates the GitHub Release from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section, in one workflow. Verifies the tag matches `package.json` and runs the full `npm run verify` gate before publishing. |
| `self-dogfood.yml` | `workflow_run` on CI completion + `workflow_dispatch` | Submits this repo's own CI verdict through the same public dispatch path consumers use (honest `fail` submissions included) — builds the submission with the local CLI, dispatches with the workflow's own `github.token` (consumers use their `DOGFOOD_TOKEN`), guarded against the ingest-commit loop. |
| `atlas-render.yml` | `schedule` (`0 6 * * 1`, Monday 06:00 UTC) + `workflow_dispatch` | Renders every public repository that has adopted Atlas onto the `atlas-render` branch, and opens an issue when the divergence set changes. |

All action SHAs pinned (no floating `@v4`). The $130 GitHub Actions incident memory (`memory/github-actions-incident.md`) is why.

Adding a seventh workflow needs explicit justification.

### Commit messages
Subject line = imperative, ≤72 chars. Body explains *why* the change is being made — what changed is in the diff. Co-author trailer included. Wave-style commit messages (used during the migration) are good for orientation but not required forever.

### Test fixtures
Tests that need policy/schema/record fixtures read them from the runtime data dirs (`policies/`, `fixtures/`, `records/`). The `setupTestRoot()` pattern in `packages/ingest/ingest.test.js` is the model — copy known-good data into a temp dir, exercise the code, assert.

When a new test needs a new fixture, add it under `fixtures/<category>/<scenario>.yaml` (or `.json`). Fixture filenames should describe what they exercise: `valid/well-formed-mcp-server-record.yaml`, `invalid/missing-source-record-ids.yaml`.

### Schemas
JSON Schema 2020-12. Title and description on every schema and every property. `additionalProperties: false` unless an open-ended bag is genuinely intended. The 8 contract-spine schemas in `packages/schemas/src/json/` (those registered in `validatePayload`) are the canonical examples. Further files live in the same directory and ship via the `./json/*` subpath but are NOT registered payload schemas — swarm-internal envelopes resolved with a local Ajv: `agent-output.schema.json` (agent wave output), `case-file.schema.json` (the jury case-file, added with the adjudication layer), and `dogfood-roadmap.schema.json` (the trajectory-layer artifact, added with the wave-39 feature pass), and `atlas-divergence.schema.json` (the Atlas divergence report, added with the Atlas Phase 0 build). Twelve `.schema.json` files total: 8 registered + 4 envelopes.

`$id` URLs point at the canonical monorepo path: `https://github.com/dogfood-lab/testing-os/packages/schemas/src/json/<name>.schema.json`. If you ever change a schema in a way that consumers should treat as a contract change, bump the workspace lockstep version — `$id` is a contract field.

### Ship gate
`SHIP_GATE.md` at the repo root tracks what shipcheck audits. Hard gates A–D (Security, Errors, Operator Docs, Hygiene) currently pass at 100% (22 checked / 15 SKIP-with-justification / 0 unchecked at v1.12.0, re-affirmed 2026-09-06 against the current SHIP_GATE.md). Soft gate E (Identity) is fully met. Re-run `npx @mcptoolshop/shipcheck audit` before any release; if a previously-checked item fails, fix the underlying gap before bumping the version.

### Runtime data dirs at the repo root
`policies/`, `fixtures/`, `records/`, `indexes/`, `reports/`, `swarms/`, `dogfood/`, `docs/`. These are the **shared backing store** that consumers (e.g. `repo-knowledge`, `shipcheck`) read from via `raw.githubusercontent.com/dogfood-lab/testing-os/main/...` URLs. The paths inside those dirs are part of the public API. **Don't reorganize them without thinking about every consumer first.**

## Verification

The full local check:
```bash
npm install
npm run build      # tsc --build (composite refs)
npm test           # workspace fan-out: vitest for schemas, node --test for the rest
npm run verify     # the canonical pre-commit check
                   # = sync-version:check → check-doc-drift → check-regression-pins → build → test:scripts → test
                   # WARNING: `npm run build && npm test` is NOT equivalent — it skips the four
                   # doc-drift / regression-pin / version-sync / scripts gates that the pre-commit
                   # discipline depends on.
```

Per-package isolation:
```bash
npm test --workspace @dogfood-lab/findings
```

CI runs the same `verify` flow on Node 22 + 24.

## Working with the legacy

The legacy repo (`mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs`) is **archived but not deleted**. The 30-day grace window before Session H delete started 2026-04-25 and **passed on 2026-05-25**; deletion is still gated on Mike's explicit go/no-go (still pending as of the last update to this section, 2026-07-02). Several historical references remain on purpose:

- Old records have `repo: "mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs"` and old paths in their provenance — these are historical truth, not bugs
- `dogfood-lab/testing-os/policies/repos/mcp-tool-shop-org/dogfood-labs.yaml` — the policy file *for* the legacy repo itself; archived artifact
- `swarms/manifest-schema.json` `$id` is `dogfood-labs.local/...` — a local-namespace URL, not a GitHub reference
- `repo-knowledge`'s `loadIntelligenceExport` has a back-compat fallback that tries `tools/findings/cli.js` (legacy layout) after `packages/findings/cli.js` (new layout) — keep that fallback until Session H verifies no callers depend on it

Schema `$id` URLs **were updated** in Session E and now point at the canonical monorepo path. Do not roll those back.

When in doubt about a legacy reference: **don't normalize it for aesthetics**. The historical record is the historical record.

## Mission, finally

This repo is named `testing-os` because that's its function: the operating system *for* testing. Its own quality bar must be exemplary. If `testing-os` ships sloppy tests, no one will trust its judgment about anyone else's tests. The way out of that trap is a daily discipline:

> **Read the failing test before reading the production code. Write the failing test before writing the fix. Run `npm run verify` before pushing. When you cut a corner, write down the corner you cut in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) so it doesn't disappear.**

Eat first. Ship second.
